According to recent CDC data, the prevalence of ASD in the United States has climbed to 1 in 36 children. The symptoms of ASD can manifest in a wide range of ways, and the illness itself exhibits signi fi cant variations. Furthermore, it has been closely linked to experiencing stress and worry in one's life, which many people refer to as sensory processing disorder (SPD). SPD is a disorder that describes how people behave when they are exposed to environmental stimuli that they may not normally process by feeling more intense than what is causing them to worry and distress. One of the most signi fi cant limiting factors that can prevent someone  from  engaging  in  what  they  need  to  do  in  their  everyday  lives  is  stress. Individuals with ASD deal with stress on a regular basis, which has a big impact on how they function. In order to address a signi fi cant research vacuum concerning the use of assistive  and  emerging  technologies  to  reduce  stress  in  individuals  with  ASD,  this systematic review aims to investigate performance, measuring techniques, and interventions by gathering data from the past 10 years. In order to determine the research hypothesis, particular research questions, and the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the studies, the research process entails gathering studies through systematic review analysis in accordance with the PRISMA principles. Experimental and observational studies on the  use  of  assistive  and  emerging  technologies  for  stress  and  anxiety  management  in children and adolescents with ASD that were published only in English met the inclusion criteria. Research not directly related to stress and anxiety outcomes, articles published in languages other than English, and research conducted outside of the designated time frame were also excluded. The study's fi ndings demonstrated that the technologies under examination had bene fi cial impacts on reducing stress; nonetheless, notable limitations were found that could compromise the replication and generalizability of legitimate and dependable applications in their utilization.\n\nAcademic Editors: Fabrizio Stasolla and Daniele Giansanti\n\nReceived: 27 February 2025 Revised: 31 March 2025 Accepted: 3 April 2025 Published: 4 April 2025\n\nCitation: Pergantis, P.; Bamicha, V.; Doulou, A.; Christou, A.I.; Bardis, N.; Skianis, C.; Drigas, A.

Introduction\n\nAccording to  the  most  recent  CDC  estimates,  approximately  1  in  36  children  are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), with data pointing to a fourfold higher incidence in boys. The prevalence in Greece among children aged 10 to 11 years is 1.15% [1].  Although  each  person  with  the  disorder  is  unique,  ASD  is  characterized  by  key features, and abnormal early brain development and neuronal reorganization appear to be  contributing  factors  to  the  cause  of  ASD.  Social  interactions  are  frequently  quite challenging for people with ASD. These challenges could include trouble keeping eye contact and  facial expressions, adjusting to social norms  and  expectations,  and comprehending  the  intentions  and  feelings  of  others.  People  with  ASD  could fi nd  it di ffi cult to make and keep friends, they might not comprehend that social interactions are two-way, or they might feel awkward sharing their hobbies and interests [2]. Avoiding eye contact, not responding to names, extreme fear, and a lack of interactive and pretend play are some of the symptoms of ASD, which di ff er from child to child. Children who receive early diagnosis and intervention have been shown to have be tt er social outcomes and  higher  independence  as  adults,  which  ultimately  saves  healthcare  expenses  and lessens family stress. Long-term, substantial cost savings also decreased the demand for special education services and more intense treatments. It has also been demonstrated that an early diagnosis results in early enrollment in specialized educational programs that are designed to meet the particular requirements of children with ASD. For these children, these activities provide enhanced socialization opportunities and enhanced scholastic or educational results [3]. Many researchers have also studied the association between the diet  of  pregnant  mothers  and  environmental  factors  that  may  also  contribute  to  this phenomenon.  However,  because  there  are  no  reliable  biomarkers,  diagnosis  is  based solely on behavior [4]. ASD is a highly comorbid disorder that includes anxiety, ADHD, obsessive-compulsive disorder, mood disorders, and other behavioral disorders, which show considerable heterogeneity in  the  recent  literature.  A  recent  meta-analysis  of  30 studies measuring the prevalence of anxiety and 29 studies measuring the prevalence of depression  by  [5]  found  that  46%  of  patients  had  a  comorbid  behavioral  challenging disorder,  8%  had  mood  disorders,  and  66%  of  over  600  patients  had  more  than  one concurrent condition. Children with ADHD who sought therapy had a similar incidence of  any  anxiety  illness  (42%).  Other  prevalent  health  issues  include  selective  eating, gastrointestinal  diseases,  sleep  issues,  seizures,  obesity,  and  dietary  limitations  [6].  In terms  of  cognitive  functioning,  individuals  with  ASD  demonstrate  a  wide  range  of abilities, from severe cognitive impairment to superior and high intelligence. Studies in people  with  ASD  with  and  without  cognitive  impairment  have  found  signi fi cant di ff erences between groups in terms of symptom severity and subsequent outcomes. In addition,  cognitive  impairment  may  be  more  common  in  women,  in  individuals  with known birth defects, and in individuals with dysmorphic features, suggesting that there may be subgroups with di ff erent etiologies or risk factors [7]. Since they are frequently the initial point of contact for parents, pediatricians are crucial to the early discovery of an individual with ASD. Because of widespread media coverage and the internet, parents are  now  much  be tt er  equipped  to  identify  the  early  indicators  of  autism  spectrum disorder. If their child exhibits any of the symptoms above, they are more likely to voice their concerns to their child's pediatrician. Pediatricians need to be aware of the symptoms of autism spectrum disorder and have a plan in place for systematically evaluating them.\n\nAdditionally,  pediatricians  need  to  know  about  local  services  that  can  assist  them  in diagnosing and treating ASD [8].", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 8603, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "------------------\nMetadata:\n{metadata_str}\n\nContent:\n\n{content}\n------------------", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "800bbdc3-8a20-410e-aac4-0bff28ef4340": {"__data__": {"id_": "800bbdc3-8a20-410e-aac4-0bff28ef4340", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_name": "Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1487649, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ce7a9d80-fbee-4730-9878-1fec174d5393", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_name": "Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1487649, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "a3d8457fdf1afbabe244b9e2da37b4e06a29a0f9ae05d7b3a592e767cd9f2025", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "28fdab75-e5dc-49b9-94c4-155df3c9e0d3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_name": "Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1487649, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "cd853773ae297b141821b7f1b03deadbe2882b9a890e1f5c40282b8204c29186", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8e57afa1-ad5a-47a3-bc1b-74af03beba69", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cec33f3b4fff27fe126cdb1ef5bb2d9ada546c31ede44874fa97e2a81fae6e7e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Additionally,  pediatricians  need  to  know  about  local  services  that  can  assist  them  in diagnosing and treating ASD [8]. Although ASD can be diagnosed as young as 18 months of age, recent research has shown that the average age of diagnosis of ASD is between 38 and 120 months. Early detection of ASD can lead to early treatment, which improves later cognitive and language skills and reduces the underlying symptoms. Although there has been some criticism of universal screening of children with ASD due to lack of evidence, it  is  widely  recognized  that  identi fi cation  and  early  intervention  are  critical  to  public health priorities. Close monitoring of changes in the age of diagnosis of ASD over time will  help  us  assess  whether  e ff orts  to  improve  access  to  early  identi fi cation  and intervention are successful [9].\n\nImproving the quality of life for children with ASD requires an explanation of the neurological mechanisms underlying their stress and anxiety. Since traditional therapy interventions frequently fail to alleviate symptoms, innovative and creative alternatives are needed. New treatment instruments have lately been made possible by advancements in technology. Emerging and assistive technologies have the potential to o ff er adaptive support and real-time monitoring that can alleviate stress and address a range of speci fi c requirements in the population with ASD.\n\nA condition known as sensory processing disorder (SPD) a ff ects people with ASD in terms  of  their  ability  to  interpret  information  from  their  surroundings.  Although  [10] proposed a classi fi cation of sensory processing disorders, many therapists prefer to refer to children as having di ffi culties processing and integrating stimuli; therefore, this term is not widely accepted. Excessive or insu ffi cient responsiveness to normal levels of input from the sensory organs is known as sensory modulation disorder (SMD) [11]. Finding possible sensory stimuli and modifying the nervous system's reaction to them are both parts of the neurological process of sensory control. Sensory regulation is the intricate process of interpreting sensory data and generating reactions that are suitably calibrated or consistent with the circumstances. This ability to regulate and organize reactions to sensory inputs, fi ltering out unimportant stimuli and concentrating on the crucial ones while  preserving  the  optimal  level  of  arousal,  is  referred  to  by  this  word.  A  person's general quality of life, ability to overcome obstacles in daily life, and ability to interact with  their  physical  and  social  environment  are  all  impacted  by  this  basic  human functioning skill. SMD o ff ers a crucial dimension for connecting with other categorical diagnostic  entities  that  were  previously  thought  of  separately,  making  it  an  essential component of stress response physiology. In 2020, according to [12] overprotective and avoidant behaviors, as well as inappropriate reactions to harmless sensory inputs, are common in people with SMD. These actions frequently do not align with the expectations and requirements of the surroundings. According to research conducted on children with SMD, exposing them to sensory stimuli in a lab se tt ing has an impact on their sympathetic and  parasympathetic  nervous  systems  from  a  neurophysiological  standpoint.  Many unique  behaviors,  including  active  sensation  seeking  and/or  extreme  sensitivity  to sensory  inputs,  can  be  displayed  by  people  with  SMD.  Innocent  sensory  inputs  that provide unpleasant, painful, or annoying feelings can cause defensive re fl exes, withdrawal from everyday activities, or elevated stress levels. Other symptoms of SMD include  tiredness,  apathy,  or  passivity.  It  can  also  manifest  as  delayed  reactions  to environmental  stimuli  of  normal  intensity.  As  a  result,  it  is  evident  that  SMD  can negatively  a ff ect functional and developmental abilities, which  hinders e ff ective participation [13,14].\n\nThe  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  de fi nes  assistive  technology  (AT)  as  a general term that encompasses all systems and services associated with the use of assistive devices and service delivery [15]. In general, it is de fi ned as 'any item, piece of equipment or  system,  whether  acquired,  modi fi ed  or  adapted  for  commercial  purposes,  that  is\n\ncommonly used to enhance, maintain or improve the functioning of an individual' in accordance with the United States' Assistive Technology Act of 1998 [16]. AT is separated into high-tech (programming-based) technologies, like computers, and low-tech (programming-free) technologies, like pencil grips and magnifying lenses [17]. Researchers such as [18] also classify AT into two types: low or simple technology and high  and  complex  technology.  Low  or  simple  technology  has  been  described  as equipment that most often has a low cost and is easy to create or acquire. It is, therefore, devices that require a simpli fi ed process for their operation (pencils, calculators, paper and laminated communication boards, wheelchairs, etc.). Complex technology refers to equipment that has electronic technology (computers, electronic communication boards, electric  wheelchairs,  etc.).  Thus  far,  assistive  technology  has  shown  to  be  a  useful instrument for enhancing the quality of life for all individuals with disabilities. Through assistive  technology,  people  with  disabilities  can  lead  successful,  independent,  and healthy  lives  while  participating  in  civic  life,  the  workforce,  and  education.  People frequently experience poverty, loneliness, and marginalization in the absence of assistive technology,  which  exacerbates  the  e ff ects  of  illness  and  disability  on  patients,  their families, and society at large. Assistive technology tools have a signi fi cant impact on the well-being of children with ASD, providing new opportunities for therapeutic approaches to improve various skills that contribute to the social inclusion of these children [19].\n\nEmerging technologies are technologies that are at an early stage of development. This means that certain aspects, such as the characteristics of technology and its context of use or the network con fi guration of actors and their relative roles, are still uncertain and unde fi ned [20]. They are de fi ned as technologies that have the potential to be relevant to society within the next 10 to 15 years. This means that they are currently in the early stages of their development, but at the same time, they have moved beyond the purely conceptual stage [21]. Emerging technologies can be summarized as the de fi nition of fi ve key  elements.  These  are  (1)  full  innovation,  (2)  relatively  rapid  development,  (3) consistency, (4) signi fi cant impact, and (5) uncertainty and ambiguity. More speci fi cally, we conceive of emerging technology as a completely new and relatively rapidly evolving technology that is characterized by a certain degree of consistency that is maintained over time  and  has  the  potential  to  have  a  signi fi cant  impact  on  socio-economic  sectors. Moreover, it is observed in terms of the composition of actors, institutions, and pa tt erns of  interaction  between  them,  as  well  as  related  knowledge  production  processes  [22]. Emerging technologies include a broad and wide variety of technological developments that  include  arti fi cial  intelligence  (AI),  computer  vision  (computer  vision),  cellular communications,  virtual  reality  (VR)  and  augmented  reality  (AR),  robotics,  drones, exergames, and serious games. This research will examine and synthesize the prevailing knowledge about the importance of technology in the fi eld of combating and managing anxiety  and  stress  in  autistic  children  and  adolescents  to  provide  feasible  and  more e ff ective solutions. For the purpose of this study, emerging technologies will be placed in the category of high-tech AT aids.\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods\n\n## 2.1. Study Design\n\nThe study design of this research was derived from the application of a systematic review approach followed by the PRISMA statement of systematic reviews and metaanalyses,  reassuring  rigorous  and  robust  delivery  through  identi fi cation,  selection, assessment, and synthesis of the fi nalized included studies.

What are the measurements used to detect the outcomes?\n- RQ4. What are the e ff ect sizes of the studies?\n\nFor the purpose of this systematic review, research of the literature was conducted to explore the last ten years, studying the changes that have occurred in the years before and after COVID-19 in conjunction with the development of the Industrial Revolution 4.0 in the daily lives of people with ASD and how new emerging and assistive technologies can be bene fi cial in combating neurophysiological stress and anxiety.\n\n## 2.2. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria\n\nTo  produce  results,  principles  were  used  that  followed  speci fi c  criteria  for  the inclusion and exclusion of speci fi c categories of research and articles, which were included in the fi nal analysis for the main part.\n\nMore speci fi cally, the inclusion criteria for the main part include the following:\n\n- IC1: Research conducted between January 2014 and 30 March 2024 will be included.\n- IC2:  Experimental  studies,  observational  studies,  and  original  research  will  be included.\n- IC3: Research and studies that are published in English only will be included.\n- IC4:  The  use  of  new,  assistive,  and  emerging  technologies  exclusively  for  the management of neurophysiological stress and anxiety will be included.\n- IC5: Populations that have research inclusion criteria that are relevant to ASD and may include comorbidities with other conditions will be included.\n- IC6:  Research  samples  of  children  and  adolescents  up  to  21  years  of  age  will  be included.\n\nThe following were the exclusion criteria for the study:\n\n- EC1: Studies conducted before 2014 and after March 2024 will not be included.\n\n- EC2: Studies of literature, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses of other studies will not be included.\n- EC3: Studies published in a language other than English will not be included.\n- EC4: Studies that include the use of new technologies or assistive technologies that do not include at least stress and anxiety in the outcome measures will not be used.\n- EC5: Studies that include other populations of neurodevelopmental disorders will not be used unless they involve a comorbidity with ASD or suggest a corresponding study in that population.\n- EC6: Included studies will not contain a sample of subjects older than 21 years of age.\n\n## 2.3. Databases Screened and Selection Process\n\nTo obtain the fi nalized sample for analysis, the following databases were processed systematically to analyze the literature, which included PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. Google Scholar was used as a supplementary database. Eligibility requirements formed the foundation of the selection process. A keyword list for the database was also generated  using  Boolean  operators  and  various  search  algorithms  to  obtain  the  best results.\n\nThe  methodology  followed,  as  previously  discussed,  was  based  on  PRISMA principles using the snowball method for article selection, and the keywords used were autism  spectrum  disorder  (ASD);  assistive  technologies  (AT);  emerging  technologies; stress; neurophysiological stress; anxiety and their combination (Table 1).\n\nTable 1. Research data string.\n\n- 'Autism Spectrum Disorder' OR 'ASD' OR 'Assistive Technologies' OR 'AT' OR 'Emerging Technologies' OR 'Stress' OR 'Neurophysiological Stress' OR 'Anxiety'\n\n## AND\n\n'Autism Spectrum Disorder' AND ('Assistive Technologies' OR 'AT') AND ('Emerging Technologies') AND ('Stress' OR 'Neurophysiological Stress') AND ('Anxiety')\n\n## AND\n\n'ASD' AND ('Assistive Technologies' OR 'AT') AND ('Emerging Technologies') AND ('Stress' OR 'Neurophysiological Stress') AND ('Anxiety')\n\n## AND\n\n'Autism Spectrum Disorder' AND ('Assistive Technologies' OR 'AT') AND ('Emerging Technologies') AND ('Neurophysiological Stress' OR 'Physiological Stress' OR 'Cortisol Levels' OR 'Heart Rate Variability') AND ('Anxiety' OR 'Emotional Dysregulation' OR 'Mental Health')\n\nAn advanced search was then conducted using Boolean operators and fi lters in the databases. As soon as the candidate studies were selected, we started further processing. During the abstract/title screening step, studies that included the prede fi ned terms in both the abstract and the title were given priority. Duplicate papers were then removed, and references  that  did  not  meet  the  eligibility  requirements  were  excluded.  Redundant references were eliminated using Mendeley Desktop 1.19.8.\n\nThe remaining studies underwent further processing during the full-text screening phase.  Following  the  next  steps,  the  full-text  documents  were  acquired,  and  the information was carefully reviewed. The selection process also took into account other factors, such as the methodological practices used in each study. Four reviewers, P.P. and V.B.,  A.D.  (Aikaterini  Doulou),  and  A.C.,  independently  identi fi ed  the  studies  that quali fi ed. The reviewers could choose to accept, reject, or remain undecided. In the event that the other reviewers were unsure or disagreed, a discussion was held with the input of the fi fth (C.S.), sixth (N.B.), and seventh A.D. (Athanasios Drigas) reviewers. After the research  was  evaluated,  the  reviewers  collected  the  relevant  data  and  organized  it  in\n\ntables. After that, the results were combined. The qualitative synthesis o ff ered a critical overview, analysis, and evaluation of the body of evidence discussed in this review.\n\n## 2.4. Data Extraction\n\nData  collected  from  the  included  studies  referred  to  participant  demographics, information (authors, year, country), speci fi cs related to the research questions formulated, and aspects of the studies' structure (type of study, aim, conditions, measures, key fi ndings, e ff ect sizes, and longitudinal e ff ects).\n\n## 2.5. Included Studies\n\nFollowing processing, inclusion, and representative criteria for the main part ( n = 36) in the fi nal selection for additional study and analysis, a total of n = 293 articles were found and screened for the included studies. The literature review included the years 2014-2024. Establishing the eligibility criteria was an initial step in the selection process. A list of keywords was also created to start the database search, which made use of a variety of search fi lters and Boolean operators in order to optimize the quantity of results. Following the elimination of duplicate studies ( n = 73), the selection procedure was conducted using title and abstract screening in compliance with the eligibility criteria ( n = 220).\n\nThe  next  step  in  the  process  was  full-text  screening  after  95  publications  were excluded.  The  remaining studies  ( n =  125)  were  processed  thoroughly.  Unfortunately, retrieving n = 12 articles for full-text screening was not feasible. The fi nal selection process involved fi ve independent reviewers, as discussed previously, who debated whether the eligibility  requirements  were  applicable  while  looking  over  the  full  texts  of  ( n =  113) papers. The remaining ( n = 77) were removed since they did not fi t the eligibility criteria. Consequently, ( n = 36 items) were included in the fi nal selection (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1. PRISMA 2020 fl ow diagram.\n\n## 3. Theoretical Knowledge\n\n## 3.1. Neurophysiological Stress and Anxiety\n\nIn  the  twentyfi rst  century,  stress  is  the  main  contributor  to  health  issues.  When managed, stress can be good for our physical and mental well-being, but if it persists for an extended period of time, it can cause a number of issues that can signi fi cantly a ff ect a person's functioning and general health [23].", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 17315, "end_char_idx": 26009, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "------------------\nMetadata:\n{metadata_str}\n\nContent:\n\n{content}\n------------------", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68266e50-1dc8-4508-8590-d70926904280": {"__data__": {"id_": "68266e50-1dc8-4508-8590-d70926904280", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_name": "Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1487649, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ce7a9d80-fbee-4730-9878-1fec174d5393", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_name": "Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1487649, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "a3d8457fdf1afbabe244b9e2da37b4e06a29a0f9ae05d7b3a592e767cd9f2025", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8e57afa1-ad5a-47a3-bc1b-74af03beba69", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_name": "Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1487649, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "297e7830c992864ad114fd4d7853596caa160b75c85e0a2318d5a6ea67b38ca0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "53d97241-b6d7-48bd-ad56-8820d875860f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "925ac9bf1eddabc0afd5b2fa6a4bb615bd3b19da45672121e4ac73e28bb8d622", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Stress might appear as a real or possible threat that necessitates a quick adjustment in behavior. Neural circuits and the brain are essential for the processes of stress response, adaption, and recuperation. More precisely, our nervous system is in charge of deciding what is dangerous and regulating the body's behavior and physiological changes in response to a stressor [24].\n\nIn response to stress and other experiences, the growing brain demonstrates notable neuroplasticity (structural and functional plasticity), including synaptic pruning, dendritic remodeling, and neuronal replacement. Stress can cause disruptions in the brain circuits supporting mood, anxiety, judgment, and cognition, which can alter how these behavioral  states  manifest.  This  imbalance  also  impacts  systemic  physiology  through immunological, metabolic, autonomic, and neuroendocrine mediators [25]. To lessen the threat, the stress response triggers a number of defense systems, such as the hormonal messenger system [26].\n\nMore precisely, the catecholamines norepinephrine and epinephrine are signi fi cant peripheral  stressors,  while  the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  (HPA)  axis  controls glucocorticoids  (GCs).  Both  of  these  systems  are  regulated  by  the  autonomic  nervous system (ANS), which is composed of the parasympathetic nervous system, sympathetic nervous system, and sympathetic-adrenal cortex. The internal control nerve system's ANS and HPA axes are both intimately related to the autonomic nucleus centers. Following stressor  exposure,  the  central  ANS  is  swiftly  activated,  peripheral  catecholamine production increases rapidly, and the HPA axis is activated immediately thereafter. The anterior pituitary creates and releases adrenocorticotropin hormones into the bloodstream following the fi rst release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in the portal pituitary circuit. This, in turn, triggers the pituitary's release of GCs like cortisol. A mostly negative stress response is produced when circulating GCs a tt ach to GC receptors. Additionally, circulating GCs augment certain sympathetically mediated actions. Crucially, the adrenal cortex is directly regulated by the ANS, which could promote the release of GC [27].\n\n## 3.2. Gut-Brain Axis\n\nAn interesting idea in the fi eld of health and disease is that the gut microbiome has the  ability  to  communicate  with  areas  of  the  brain  that  can  regulate  behavior  [28]. Examining the interaction between the gut and brain through neurobiological research has revealed a complex system of two-way communication that can maintain homeostasis and proper digestion and impact motivation and higher cognitive function. The brain-gut axis is a bidirectional communication system consisting of neural pathways, such as the enteric  nervous  system  'ENS',  vagus,  sympathetic  and  spinal  nerves,  and  chemical pathways, including cytokines, hormones, and neuropeptides as signaling molecules [29].\n\nEmotion-related peripheral pa tt erns, motor activity, excretion, and immunity in the gastrointestinal tract are controlled by both sympathetic and parasympathetic neurosis [30]. Current methods to identify the bacteria that make up the gut microbiota depend on omics analysis using advanced high-tech equipment [29].\n\nBacteria  are  essential  for  normal  brain  development  as  well  as  brain  function  in adulthood. Neuroplasticity in the adult brain is regulated by the microbiota, which is a critical process involved in neurogenesis and microglia activation. Such discoveries have\n\ncontributed to a paradigm shift in neuroscience and psychiatry so that early development and subsequent brain function can be altered by targeting the microbiome [31].\n\nThe microbiome also a ff ects the structure and function of the amygdala, another key brain region associated with stress. The amygdala is essential for emotional learning and social behavior, as well as for the activation of behavioral and physiological responses to stressful  stimuli,  particularly  those  that  induce  anxiety  and/or  fear  [32].  Disrupted amygdaloid processes have been implicated in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders, including the autism spectrum [31].\n\nThe  microbiome  contributes  to  the  regulation  of  neurotransmi tt ers  by  generating serotonin, dopamine, GABA, histamine, and acetylcholine, both directly and indirectly. The gut microbiota expresses a number of neurotransmi tt er receptors, which explains the direct  in fl uence  of  the  CNS  on  gut  microbiota.  All  these  tasks  are  performed  in coordination with the autonomic, enteric, and neuroendocrine systems, and the HPA axis also contributes [33,34].\n\n## 3.3. Structural and Functional Di ff erences Caused by Stress in Early Development\n\nPsychosocial  stressors,  especially  when  present  early  in  life,  contribute  to  the development of anxiety and depressive disorders. In the cognitive domain, changes have also been observed in children exposed to chronic stress early in life.\n\nEven  after  controlling  for  sociodemographic  variables  like  maternal  IQ,  delivery complications,  gender,  ethnicity,  and  birth  weight,  these  e ff ects  remained.  Language, memory,  a tt ention, and executive function are the domains that are engaged. Furthermore, babies that experience stress at a young age frequently have more cognitive biases.  For  instance,  they  are  less  likely  to  notice  positive  facial  expressions  and  more prone  to  perceive  social  cues  as  hostile  than  children  who  have  never  experienced psychological distress. Additionally, these children were twice as likely to repeat courses, had poorer work habits, and struggled to build them on their own. They also scored lower on intelligence and academic success assessments and had lower IQ scores. Furthermore, children who experience neglect are more likely to experience behavioral issues. Some of these  behavioral  issues  can  be  brought  on  by  a  decrease  in  cognitive fl exibility. Psychosocial functioning is still impacted. They displayed outcomes linked to decreased social skills and lower behavioral control when their professors evaluated them [35].\n\nThe  study  by  [36]  examined  the  relationship  between  early  stress  and  mesial microstructural integrity in a sample of healthy controls aged 8 to 73 years. Participants were divided into four age groups (8-12, 13-18, 19-50, 51-73). For fractional anisotropy (FA) mesoclavium, a comparison was made between those with three or more morning stress  events  and  those  with  fewer  than  three  events.  During  separate  analyses,  both groups  were  tested  for  verbal  memory,  information  processing  speed,  psychomotor speed,  and  cognitive fl exibility.  The  results  showed  that  both  the  younger  and  older groups  of  early  stressed  subjects  had  signi fi cantly  lower  gender-speci fi c  fractional anisotropy  than  those  without  early  stress.  However,  no  di ff erences  were  observed between groups for any of the cognitive tasks. Through this research, it was found that early stress is associated with subtle changes in brain structure but not function.\n\nThe  study  by  [37],  through  their  systematic  literature  review,  examined  how developmental  stress,  particularly  childhood  maltreatment,  may  a ff ect  the  HPA  axis' function and hippocampal structure. In addition, they examined the relationship between HPA axis  function  and  hippocampal  volume  in  healthy  states,  depression,  and  other diseases.  Evidence  was  observed  that  prenatal  stress  and  childhood  maltreatment  are associated  with  abnormal  development  of  the  HPA  system,  as  well  as  reduced hippocampal volume. Reduced hippocampal volume was also associated with increased daily  cortisol  secretion.  The  conclusions  concluded  that  a  model  incorporating  child\n\nmaltreatment, cortisol abnormalities, and hippocampal volume may need to account for other factors such as temperament, genetics, or the presence of depression, providing a holistic  explanation  of  all fi ndings.

These fi ndings imply that  structural  alterations  in  the  prefrontal  cortex  might  be  a  mechanism  via  which increased cumulative stress results in diminished cognitive function.\n\nThe  current  study's  authors  [39]  looked  at  how  teenagers'  brain  structures  and functional activation to images evoking negative emotions, as well as the stress levels in mothers' self-reported items, a ff ected their cortisol responses to stress. Data on maternal stress perception and salivary cortisol responses to a demanding task were gathered from 66 mothers and adolescents, ages 12 to 14. The teens' brain structure and function were then evaluated by MRI. Adolescent reactivity in the medial prefrontal cortex to negative emotional stress-inducing stimuli was predicted by higher levels of parental perceived stress but not cortisol reactivity, according to whole-brain functional studies. However, no  statistically  signi fi cant  correlations  were  shown  for  structural  analyses.  Given  the fi nding that maternal responses to stress are associated with adolescent medial prefrontal cortex function, parental stress may play a role in the development of the neuropsychiatric stress system in adolescence, with potential implications.\n\nIn the study by [40], through a systematic review of the literature on functional MRI, as well as a meta-analysis of research regarding structural MRI sensory imaging of brain tumors  in  pediatric  patients  with  pos tt raumatic  experiences,  a  possible  association between  early  traumatic  experiences  and  variant  brain  regions  and  functions  was investigated.  A  meta-analysis  assessing  group  di ff erences  was  conducted  using  all amygdala,  hippocampus,  brain  tumor,  and  intracranial  tumor  data  that  satis fi ed  the inclusion  criteria.  According  to  the  meta-analysis,  PTSD  patients  had  a  reduced intracranial volume, total brain volume, and total cortical area. The gray ma tt er volume of the frontal lobe and amygdala and the total gray ma tt er volume of the hippocampus (left  and  right)  were  all  decreased,  although  these  di ff erences  were  not  statistically signi fi cant.  Functional  investigations  showed  that  the  PTSD/PTSD  symptom  group di ff ered in how di ff erent parts of the brain were activated in response to stimuli.\n\nIn  the  study  by  [41],  27  young  subjects  with  PTSD  and  21  typically  developing subjects without trauma were assessed at baseline and at a one-year follow-up. During each visit, the youth underwent structural MRI and functional resting MRI at each visit. Areas  showing  volumetric  abnormalities  on  whole-brain  structural  analyses  were identi fi ed and used as seeds in exploratory analyses of intrinsic connectivity. The results showed that young subjects with PTSD showed persistently reduced gray ma tt er volume in the right dorsal prefrontal cortex and a bilateral ventrally arranged prefrontal cortex. Group  analyses  over  time  revealed  abnormal  longitudinal  growth  of  the  bilateral prefrontal cortex, with typically developing adolescents showing a normal decrease in the right dorsal prefrontal cortex from baseline to follow-up, whereas adolescents with PTSD showed  an  increase.  Using  these  regions  as  seeds,  PTSD  patients  showed  atypical longitudinal decreases in intrinsic connectivity of the prefrontal cortex and amygdala as well  as  with  the  hippocampus,  in  contrast  to  increases  in  developing  adolescents,\n\nspeci fi cally. Speci fi cally, adolescents with PTSD showed increased ventricular connectivity of the prefrontal cortex and amygdala as well as with the hippocampus over time. Also, volumetric abnormalities of the interventricular PFC and extraventricular PFC were predictive of symptom severity.\n\n## 3.4. ASD, Sensory Modulation Disorder (SMD), and Stress Due to Hyperreactivity to Stimuli\n\nSMD has been widely recognized and linked in the literature as one of the primary sensory  processing  issues  a ff ecting  people  with  ASD.  In  their  research,  [14]clearly identi fi ed sensory processing dysfunction in children with ASD and contrasted it with SMD as  two  distinct  characteristics.  Thirty-three  generally  developing  children  (4-12 years old), thirty-eight children with ASD (5-15 years old), and thirty-one children with ASD problems (5-13 years old) participated in the study. The respondents' arousal and reactivity were examined and quanti fi ed by the researchers in a lab se tt ing. The results showed  that  the  two  clinical  groups  di ff ered  from  one  another.  Children  with  ASD exhibited lower initial arousal and reduced reactions when shown a laboratory example of  sensory  problems.  The  ASD  and  SMD  clinical  groups  exhibited  considerably  more abnormal sensory-related behaviors than children with usual development. In addition, there  were  three  di ff erences  between  the  two  groups:  the  ASD  group  showed  more proprioceptive and vestibular behaviors, which were signs of sensory under-reactivity; the la tt er group showed more sensation-seeking behaviors; and the former group showed more signs of hyperreactivity to taste and smell.\n\nBy comparing sensory processing, social participation, and praxis in a group of 79 children aged 5 to 8 years (M = 6.09), 14 of whom were girls and 65 of whom were boys, [42] added more fi ndings. The children were divided into two groups: the ASD group ( n = 41) and the standard development comparison group ( n = 38). The researchers assessed the  children's  sensory  pro fi les  using  a  sensory  processing  measure  (SPM).  Details  on aspects of their home and classroom modi fi cations were supplied by parents and teachers, respectively. The ASD group received scores suggesting higher levels of dysfunction on all the evaluated measures in both situations, with the biggest di ff erences observed in the variables of the motor act and social involvement. The two senses most impacted in the ASD group were hearing and touch.\n\nOthers looked into food selectivity and oral sensitivity to SMD. [43] evaluated the oral sensory processing of children with SMD ( n = 53) and those without SDM ( n = 58) who were between the ages of 3 and 11. In addition, the researchers evaluated food in children with ASD according to their preferences, informal oral sensory processing, and fruit and vegetable consumption and how they all related to each other. They discovered that more children with ASD exhibited abnormal sensory processing than those without the disorder. Furthermore, the study revealed that children with ASD who had unusual oral sensory sensitivity ate fewer vegetables and rejected more items. More recent research has  found  associations  between  ASD  and  social  di ffi culties.  [44]  study  examined  the connection between children with ASD's social and adaptive functioning and sensory challenges.  The  researchers  looked  at  the  connections  between  abnormal  sensory processing responses and social skill de fi ciencies, impaired social cognition, and general adaptive  functioning  in  a  group  of  preschool-aged  children  with  ASD.  This  study contrasted 36 peer children of similar ages who were generally developing and 64 children with ASD aged 3 to 6 years. Measures of general adaptive functioning, social problems, and sensory processing were gathered from the parents of each child. The results of the study showed that children with ASD who experienced more sensory problems were more likely to struggle in social situations and have lower levels of adaptive functioning. When [45] compared the play activities and sensory information processing of children with  ASD (6-10  years  old)  to  those  of  age  and  gender-matched  (typically  developing\n\nchildren), they added more data on social participation. A total of 95 parents of typically developing  children  and  93  parents  of  children  with  ASD  were  surveyed  at  daycare facilities,  schools,  and  hospitals.  Both  the  sensory  pro fi le  (SP)  and  Participation  in Childhood Occupation (PICO) metrics were employed. Boys made up 74% ( n = 72) of the study's participants (with a 4:1 ratio of boys to girls) in the autistic group. The fi ndings indicated  that  sensory  processing  issues  are  linked  to  certain  childhood  participation limits. Children with ASD engaged less frequently, at a lower level, and with less pleasure than typical children their age. Compared to the typical group ( n = 95), which had sensory processing issues at 21.5% ( p = 0.28), children with ASD had sensory processing issues at 68.8%.

Parents of the two groups-105 children with ASD and 70 children with TD-were given the exam, and the groups were subsequently split into high-functioning and low-functioning groups. The fi ndings demonstrated that children with ASD  had  higher  SPM-2  subscales  and  overall scores. The  hearing, social participation,  balance,  and  movement  subscales  of  the  SPM-2  showed  a  signi fi cant di ff erence  between  children  with  high  and  low  functioning  in  the  context  of  ASD, although the total SPM-2 scores did not di ff er between the two groups of children. This research highlights that the variety of sensory pa tt erns is associated with either high or low cognitive functioning.\n\n## 3.5. Stress Measurements\n\nThe common types of psychological stress commonly measured are major life events, traumatic events, exposure to early life stress, and chronic or current stress. The choice of appropriate stressor exposure to measure depends on the relevance of the population, the research objectives, and the assumption that certain types of stress are associated with relevant  outcomes.  Capturing  a  variety  of  stressors  will  reduce  the  likelihood  of underestimating an individual's psychological and social stress [47]. Responses to stress can be measured with self-report measures, behavioral coding, or physiological measures. These responses include the emotional, cognitive, behavioral, and physiological responses elicited by stressful stimuli. One of the simplest ways of measuring stress response is a self-report of perceived stress associated with a particular stressor or life situation.\n\n[48] distinguished three ways in which stress is investigated: (1) The epidemiological tradition focuses on identifying situations and experiences that are considered stressful based  on  the  consensus  that  they  pose  a  threat  to  social  or  physical  health.  (2)  The psychological tradition focuses on individuals' perceptions of stress caused by life events based on their assessment of the threats posed and the availability of e ff ective  coping resources. (3)  The  biological  tradition  focuses  on  the  brain  disruption  of  physiological systems necessary to regulate homeostasis and normal metabolic control.\n\nOutside of the laboratory, new technologies have improved our ability to record realtime responses to stress in everyday life using mobile phones and handheld devices that are increasingly being implemented by many researchers ([49-51]. Examining the impact of stressor exposure and stress responses on health can improve the prediction of health outcomes, as many stress models suggest that these responses also mediate the e ff ects of stress exposure, which may in fl uence health outcomes [47].\n\nThe most common ways of measuring and obtaining data on the neurophysiological changes observed are as follows:\n\n- -Through GSR (galvanic skin response) by using changes in skin conductance. When stress is present, skin resistance decreases due to increased sweat secretion.\n\n- -Electromyography (EMG) measures the electrical activity of muscles. Stress causes di ff erences in muscle contraction, which can be used to determine stress levels.\n- -Skin temperature changes that correlate to an increase in stress levels.\n- -Measurement of heart rate and heart rate variability.\n- -Electrocardiogram (ECG), from which the heart rate and heart rate variability are measured. (Calculation of the variability of heart rate variability [52].\n\nMany physiology-based stress-sensing systems use machine learning and rely on three  main types of sensors: wearable sensors, external sensors, and software sensors, where sensor data collected by software do not necessarily require a dedicated hardware sensor [53].\n\n## 3.6. Measurement of Stress in Individuals with ASD\n\nIndividuals with ASD appear to have increased levels of neurophysiological stress and anxiety disorders compared to the neurotypical population and can be categorized into  three  categories:  (1)  neurophysiological  changes  in  the  presence  of  a  stressor,  (2) questionnaires of individuals with ASD and parent caregivers, and (3) those of a mixed type (neurophysiological changes and questionnaires).\n\nFrom studies conducted by various researchers who have aimed to measure these e ff ects in populations with ASD, we identi fi ed a great diversity in the mode of taking; more speci fi cally, [54] measured cortisol in children with ASD who were at rest compared to when faced with a stressor such as blood intake. In addition, the parent questionnaire was given to further the reliability of the child behavioral checklist measurements.\n\nThe fi ndings of [55] suggest a distinct neuroendocrine response to social stress in high-functioning  autistic  children  despite  similar  sympathetic  and  parasympathetic responses  to  stress  compared  to  the  neurotypical  population.  This  preliminary  study examined physiological arousal in children with high-functioning autism (HFA, n = 19) compared to a control group ( n = 11) before, during, and after the Trier Social Stress test (Trier Social Stress). The HFA group was more likely to have decreased salivary cortisol after  the  stressor,  whereas  the  comparison  group  was  more  likely  to  have  increased cortisol  ( p =  0.02);  however,  no  di ff erences  in  electrodermal  activity  (a  measure  of sympathetic  arousal)  or  vagal  tone  (a  measure  of  parasympathetic  activity)  were identi fi ed between groups.\n\nIn their study of a population with ASD compared to a neurotypical sample, [56] measured the skin's temperature, heart rate, and electrodermal activity in a sample of children  with  ASD  ( n =  12)  and  those  typically  developing  ( n =  17)  during  a  stress condition (Stroop task) and baseline condition (surveillance tape). With some regression model adjustments based on the internal period, the recovery period, the stress test, and the remainder of the main level, a comparison of saliva control, heart rate, and heart rate variability was conducted.\n\n[57]  collected behavioral and physiological measures of stress and anxiety during dental  cleaning  in  order  to  examine  the  causes  and  consequences  of  behavioral  and physiological discomfort experienced by children with ASD during normal dental visits. In the control group, which included 44 people aged 6-12 years, there were 22 individuals with ASD  and  22 individuals with neurotypical traits. Based on physiological measurements and measures of overt behavioral anxiety, classi fi ed by the researchers and dentists, the results indicated that children with ASD were more anxious than the control group. Age was linked to behavioral discomfort in the typical group, while expressive communication and sensory processing issues were linked to behavioral distress in the ASD group. Physiological dysphoria was associated with parent-reported anxiety in the typical group and with sensory processing di ffi culties in the ASD group. The following assessment  measurement  tools  were  used  to  measure  anxiety:  Child  and  Adolescent\n\nSymptom  Inventory-Anxiety  Scale  (CASI),  Children's  Fear  Survey  Schedule-Dental Subscale (CFSS-DS), Anxiety and Cooperation Scale (A &amp; C Scale), Short Sensory Pro fi le (SSP), Frankl Scale, and the Children's Dental Behavioral Rating Scale (CDBRS) from the questionnaires  used  to  measure  neurophysiological  changes,  such  as  electrodermal activity (EDA).\n\nThe aim of [58] study was to determine if Zen Shiatsu can reduce short and long-term stress levels in children with ASD. The PEDS QL 4.0 Young Child Questionnaire was used to measure stress on the impact of intervention implementation by parents [59].\n\n[60]  conducted  a  preliminary  investigation  to  evaluate  the  physiological  stress (cortisol) and regulation (respiratory sinus arrhythmia, RSA) of children aged 10 to 12 who were either normally developing (TD) ( n = 25) or who had ASD ( n = 31) after they were subjected  to  two  social  stress  protocols.  The  extent  to  which  cognitive  emotions (emotional  knowledge)  and  stress  (state  and  trait)  mediate  stress  responses  was  also investigated.  Depending  on  the  type  of  stressor,  the  results  displayed  distinct  stress response pa tt erns. Both groups regularly displayed adaptive and synergistic cortisol and RSA  responses  during  cordial  social  interactions.  However,  in  response  to  social appraisal, the ASD group did not show any correlated responses across the physiological systems, which may be due to an a tt enuated stress response from the evaluative social stressor.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 43645, "end_char_idx": 52670, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "------------------\nMetadata:\n{metadata_str}\n\nContent:\n\n{content}\n------------------", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "70e74718-a341-43ba-aad5-e5b5fd131fb0": {"__data__": {"id_": "70e74718-a341-43ba-aad5-e5b5fd131fb0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_name": "Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1487649, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ce7a9d80-fbee-4730-9878-1fec174d5393", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_name": "Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1487649, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "a3d8457fdf1afbabe244b9e2da37b4e06a29a0f9ae05d7b3a592e767cd9f2025", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a61daf9d-5647-48ad-8382-7b84f17391e6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_name": "Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1487649, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "b483985ca698b9c85ffd7c4f6666ddeb7f5d5fcaebf97d7b6ea3df2f4e85f342", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c311a6c0-5b66-4ca0-a788-fc15d5731ceb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a7200577e7eb7f7db869dd1f31b528d21bcd6d440adb71c752417203270f06f8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "However,  in  response  to  social appraisal, the ASD group did not show any correlated responses across the physiological systems, which may be due to an a tt enuated stress response from the evaluative social stressor. The following instruments were used in the present study: the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST)-Child Version, the TSST-friendly pre-baseline, salivary cortisol test, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), and the Stress Inventory for Children (STAIC).\n\nThe study by [8] investigated the relationship between stress and symptoms of ASD in this population in n = 22 without ASD and n = 24 with ASD (with a mean age of 35.7 and  31.8  each),  who  were  individuals  with  both  sensory  and  cognitive  disabilities. Physiological  stress  levels  were  determined  using  salivary  cortisol  according  to  the protocol of [61]. No additional self-report or parent and caregiver questionnaires were administered in this study. Participants with and without ASD showed no di ff erences in cortisol  levels,  as  well  as  di ff erences  between  the  OASIS  test  day  and  control  day.  In contrast, cortisol levels were positively associated with the presence of stereotypical and repetitive behaviors.\n\n[62] gathered and categorized the scales used in their systematic review in order to create  a  framework  for  researching  stress  in  people  with  OASIS  using  self-report measures. More precisely, two primary scale categories were reported: a moment-speci fi c state-like questionnaire and general trait-like stress surveys. The following subcategories, which comprised the stress-speci fi c questionnaires, were developed from these in the fi rst category: (1) Chronic Stress Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents, (2) Perceived Stress Scale, (3) Stress in Children Questionnaire, and (4) Adjusted Stress Survey Schedule, and in the second group, these were self-made questionnaires and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale questionnaires. Lastly, the Subjective Units of Distress Survey, a compliance questionnaire, was likewise found in the second category. Only the SSS, which asks the subject to score the severity of their stress responses in eight scenarios, was created for use with  individuals  with  ASD  from  the fi rst  category  listed.  (1)Threats  and  changes,  (2) expectation and uncertainty, (3) unpleasant experiences, (4) enjoyable experiences (like birthday celebrations or presents), (5) sensory and interpersonal contact, (6) food-related activities,  (7)  social  and  environmental connections, and (8) stress associated to rituals were considered [63]. [64] used resting heart rate variability (HRV) in combination with the  Emotional  Dysregulation  Inventory  to  measure  resting  heart  rate  variabilities  in adolescents with ASD compared to neurotypical subjects.\n\n## 4. Results\n\n## 4.1. Studies Characteristics\n\nThe present study gathered results from a comprehensive summary of n = 36 studies that  were fi nally pooled into this systematic review for further analysis. The included studies examined assistive and emerging technologies as mediators to detect and reduce neurophysiological stress and anxiety in children and adolescents with ASD and sensory processing disorders, which were published from 2015 to 2024 (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2. Distribution of studies by year of publication.\n\nThe  included  studies  utilized  a  diverse  set  of  research  methodologies,  including randomized control trials (RCTS) in n =  7  studies,  employing  a  rigorous  experimental design  to  evaluate  intervention  e ff ectiveness  ([65-71]).  Further  studies  ( n =  7)  utilized comparative designs without full randomization (quasi-experimental studies) ([72-78]). n = 8 more studies (pilot and feasibility) focused on assessing the feasibility and preliminary e ff ects of interventions [79-86]. Finally, in n = 5 studies (single-subject and case studies), the researchers presented detailed individual analyses of the interventions' impacts [8791]. Moreover, in n = 9 (observational and exploratory), they tried to examine real-world interactions with these types of technologies [92-100] (Figure 3).\n\nFigure 3. Distribution of study types in the systematic review.\n\nAccording to the study populations, we observed a wide variety of data collected. More speci fi cally, the sample size studies ranged from single-subject case studies up to 201  participants  ([71,72,97].  The  age  range  of  the  pool  was  primarily  children  and adolescents 3 years of age to 19 years, with some of them including young adults [65-67]. Regarding gender distribution, most of the studies reported more male samples (~8090%), re fl ecting ASD prevalence trends [73,75,87].\n\nFinally, the studies were performed across di ff erent countries (some uniquely, some co-organized, and some jointly), providing a wider approach to the interpretation of the data acquired. More speci fi cally n = 7 were from the USA [75,79,80,85,87,90,100] ; ; , n = 3 were from Canada [66,71,76] , n = 3 were from China [65,72,77], n = 3 were from Indonesia [68,69,82], n = 3 were from Qatar [81,89,91], n = 3 were from UK [70,96,97], n = 2 were from India [86,98], n = 2 were from Italy [73,95], n = 2 were from Japan [84,99], n = 1 was from Australia [88], n = 1 was from Belgium [83], n = 1 was from Netherlands [92], n = 1 was from Sweden [74], n = 1 was from Israel [94] and n = 3 were studies that were performed in multiple countries, i.e., Israel, the UK, and Sweden [67], France and Italy [78], as well as Turkey, Macedonia, the UK, and Poland [93] (Figure 4).\n\nFigure 4. Studies distribution by countries.\n\n- 4.2. Assistive and Emerging Technologies for Children and Adolescents with ASD on Stress Management (Low Technology)\n\n## 4.2.1. Visual Programs/Schedules\n\nStress and anxiety are common among persons with ASD, and they are frequently brought on by the challenges they encounter on a daily basis. Visual programs are a type of  low  technology  that  has  shown  promise  when  used  in  any  situation  where  people frequently encounter di ffi culties. A visual program is a set of pictures or words intended to motivate someone to carry out various duties. They provide abstract ideas like time and action in a concrete form by using words, pictures, and other visual elements to explain what  will  happen,  when  it  will  happen,  and  where  it  will  happen.  They  have  been e ff ectively  utilized  to  treat  issues  with  sequential  memory,  time  management,  and language understanding, as well as to lower anxiety in a range of contexts (classrooms, homes, private gyms, dental o ffi ces, etc.) [101].\n\n[76]  conducted  a  pilot  study  to  investigate  whether  a  visual  design  system  using pictorial  communication  symbols  can  help  children  with  autism  achieve  daily  oral hygiene. The study involved 14 boys with ASD, ages 3 to 8, who a tt ended a dental clinic\n\nfor four consecutive weekly dental appointments. The patients were randomly assigned to either the experimental group, which received a visual program system in addition to standard  care,  or  the  control  group,  which  received  a  'Tell-Show-DO'  approach (standard care). The results showed that the combination of a visual teaching program and  repeated  weekly  visits  seemed  to  have  helped  children  with  autism  reach  more milestones by showing higher levels of reduced behavioral distress during dental exams and cleanings.\n\n[69] compared the e ff ectiveness of using a visual training module to reduce anxiety during dental treatment with that of video modeling in a population of children with ASD. Twenty children with ASD, ages 6 to 10, participated in this experimental clinical investigation. They were split into two groups: the PV-BDG module's visual intervention group ( n = 10) and the video modeling group. To quantify salivary immunoglobulin A (sIgA) concentrations, patients' saliva was taken both before and after the intervention. The Shapiro-Wilk normality test and the independent t-test were used to analyze the data and compare how much stress was reduced in the two groups. The fi ndings demonstrated that,  as  indicated  by  changes  in  the  sIgA  levels,  video  modeling  and  visual  teaching modules might e ff ectively lower the stress levels of children with ASD while receiving dental care.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 52450, "end_char_idx": 60828, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "------------------\nMetadata:\n{metadata_str}\n\nContent:\n\n{content}\n------------------", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c311a6c0-5b66-4ca0-a788-fc15d5731ceb": {"__data__": {"id_": "c311a6c0-5b66-4ca0-a788-fc15d5731ceb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_name": "Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1487649, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ce7a9d80-fbee-4730-9878-1fec174d5393", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_name": "Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1487649, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "a3d8457fdf1afbabe244b9e2da37b4e06a29a0f9ae05d7b3a592e767cd9f2025", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "70e74718-a341-43ba-aad5-e5b5fd131fb0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_name": "Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1487649, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "dac74835b6ae2504ac0606d237782feddd692f56aadfe3ea97d2868bff2584ed", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "98a0a250-55ef-41b9-b8c3-eeeb18a37aaa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "099792aa570b487800f2ac32b2618a0329a16b0f63409a8f2807b100de2be210", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "[68] found similar results regarding the e ffi cacy of visual methods when comparing the Berkunjung ke Dokter Gigi Visual Pedagogical Module intervention method (VPMBDG) and the Berkunjung ke Dokter Gigi Video Modeling intervention method (VMBDG) in lowering anxiety levels in children with ASD while receiving dental care. Twenty children  with  ADHD,  ages  six  to  ten,  participated  equally  in  this  clinical  study  and experimental trial. Following that, they were split into two groups based on the type of intervention: VPM-BDG and VM-BDG. The children's saliva was taken both before and after the intervention, and the delta values of their salivary cortisol concentrations were measured in a lab. The Mann-Whitney test was used to analyze the e ff ectiveness of the two interventions. The mean value in the two intervention groups was -0.006 and 0.0005. The delta values of the salivary cortisol concentrations showed that VM-BDG and VPMBDG e ff ectively reduced stress levels in the tested sample of subjects.\n\nThe study by [88] evaluated the use of visual schedules and task systems to help four students  with  ASD  stay  on  task  and  work  independently  in  a  typical  classroom environment. These strategies were implemented by teachers as inclusive practices and were evaluated by observation in physical classroom environments to test their feasibility in general contexts. All participants demonstrated improvement in their behavior during the  task.  The  results  for  other  secondary  dependent  variables  were  mixed,  with  some students demonstrating decreased o ff -task behavior and increased productivity.\n\n## 4.2.2. Sensory Modalities and Wearables\n\nChildren  and  adults  with  ASD  frequently  struggle  with  sensory  processing  and modulation [102]. According to [14], [42], and [44], a person with ASD may have hyperresponsiveness (touch, hearing, smell, etc.) to the various stimuli they encounter in their surroundings. This can activate the ANS and, more speci fi cally, the sympathetic system, which can lead to an increase in stress levels in the body. The term 'wearables' refers to a  wide  range  of  items  that  users  can  wear  to  o ff er  biometric  information  about  their homeostatic condition or to normalize their level of arousal by using their features to provide input (biofeedback). The following is a list of topics that have been studied for their qualities as low- or medium-tech aids.\n\n[99],  in  their  pilot  study,  investigated  the  e ff ectiveness  of  earplugs  and  noisecanceling (NC) earplugs in relation to behavioral control of problems caused by overreactivity to auditory inputs in children with ASD. The results showed that the T-scores\n\non the Goal A tt ainment Scale (GAS) were signi fi cantly higher during the use of acoustic noise cancelation compared to baseline. During the baseline time frame, fi ve children with DSA demonstrated improved behavior from those with normal headphone (NC) use; however, there were no di ff erences in the GAS T-Goal scores between the headphone (NC) phase and the baseline phase or between the headphone and NC headphone phases. NC headphones were given to 21 children aged 4 to 16 years who had not used the sound isolator for two weeks and received normal earplugs as a sample after random selection. Participants' responses to auditory stimulation were assessed by their parents or teachers.\n\nSix children with ASD, ages 8 to 16, were examined using a multi-item treatment method  in  a  related  study  by  [75].  As  part  of  their  treatment,  participants  were randomized to wear either over-ear (above the ears) or in-ear (within the ears) hearing aids for two periods. Every child underwent four stages of investigation. The reference week was the fi rst  week of data collection; then came the intervention week, the nonintervention week, and the alternative intervention week (as is customary). The Empatica E4 bracelet was used to gather data on electrodermal activity (EDA). Five measurements were taken throughout each of the 16-20 data collection  periods  that  the  participants underwent.  The  purpose  of  this  study  was  to  determine  whether  there  is  proof  that therapies that lower children's sympathetic activity can e ff ectively treat both hypersensitive and autistic children. The current study used skin conductance measurements  to  analyze  these fi ndings.  Separate  analyses  for  paired  study  periods revealed  that  the  use  of  noise-isolating  headphones  led  to  statistically  signi fi cant variations  in  skin  conductance  levels  and  the  frequency  of  nonspeci fi c  conductance responses  between  baseline  and  post-study  periods.  The  researchers  came  to  the conclusion  that  in  individuals  with  ASD  and  auditory  hyper-responsiveness,  noiseisolating auditory sensitivity may lessen sympathetic activity.\n\n[77],  in  their  study,  took  into  account  the  heterogeneity  of  auditory  perception  in children with ASD and how it di ff ers compared to conventional isolation hearing aids. For  the  purpose  of  this  study,  they  designed  appropriate  noise  control  functions  in hearing  aids  to  meet  the  needs  of  children  with  ASD  who  have  di ff erent  auditory perceptions through a series of auditory perception and electroencephalogram tests, in which  children  with  ASD  and  with  auditory  hypersensitivity  listened  to  sounds  of di ff erent  frequencies  and  amplitudes  which  were  analyzed  through  the  subjects' responses.  Appropriate  noise  reduction  targets  were  determined  based  on  acoustic perception  curves  constructed  from  mean  acoustic  perception  values  and  noise  levels using an appropriate power function. A hybrid active noise cancelation (ANC) system based on acoustic perception was then developed and validated. The results showed that frequencies of 250 Hz and 8 kHz were considered the most unpleasant by the majority of autistic children. Participants were divided into fi ve groups using the K-means algorithm. It  was  found that each group had its own characteristic auditory perceptual response. Finally,  improvements  in  auditory  perceptual  response  were  observed  when  children used this type of headphones, with their auditory perceptual characteristics consistent with di ff erent groups of children with autism.\n\n[87] used an alternating treatment design that assessed the engagement of a 5-yearold child with ASD during math in a general education kindergarten classroom using a weighted  blanket  and  structured  work  boxes  as  objects.  The  results  showed  that  the weighted blanket did not lead to changes in therapeutic behavior, and it was observed that the student's engagement was lower than the baseline. More speci fi cally, the subject sat on the mat more often when using the blanket compared to the baseline sessions but often engaged in behaviors that were not functional (touching the blanket) or were not consistent with engagement in an academic response (e.g., pulling the blanket over his head).\n\n[85], through their research, examined children with ASD who exhibited behavioral symptoms of sensory processing de fi cits and whether weighted blankets improved sleep quality. A single-subject design study was conducted with two 4-year-old children who had been diagnosed with both ASD and sleep disorders. An 8-day baseline phase, a 14day total intervention with weighted blankets, and a 7-day removal period were used to examine the objective sleep measurements and caregiver surveys. Visual analysis and the rate  of  non-overlap  techniques  were  used  to  evaluate  the  caregivers'  accounts  and objective  data.  The  weighted  blanket  intervention  had  li tt le  e ff ect  on  sleep  pa tt erns, according  to  the  results.  However,  by  considerably  shortening  the  time  it  took  for participants to fall asleep, the usage of weighted blankets improved their morning mood and decreased stress after nigh tt ime use.\n\nThe study by [74] sought to ascertain whether using weighted blankets improved sleep and day-to-day functioning in individuals with ASD and/or ADHD. A total of 85 participants with an ADHD or ASD diagnosis, 48 children (57%) and 37 adults (44%), who were at  least  18  years  old,  were  given  a  weighted  blanket  to  utilize.  The  participants answered  over  the  phone.  The  weighted  blanket  enhanced  sleep-related  skills,  sleep quality throughout the night, and relaxation during the day, according to the results. In children and adults with ASD and/or ADHD, the use of a weighted blanket enhanced their  daily  morning/evening  routines,  including  ge tt ing  ready  for  bed  and  waking  up early.\n\n4.3.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 60830, "end_char_idx": 69602, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "------------------\nMetadata:\n{metadata_str}\n\nContent:\n\n{content}\n------------------", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "98a0a250-55ef-41b9-b8c3-eeeb18a37aaa": {"__data__": {"id_": "98a0a250-55ef-41b9-b8c3-eeeb18a37aaa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_name": "Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1487649, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ce7a9d80-fbee-4730-9878-1fec174d5393", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_name": "Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1487649, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "a3d8457fdf1afbabe244b9e2da37b4e06a29a0f9ae05d7b3a592e767cd9f2025", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c311a6c0-5b66-4ca0-a788-fc15d5731ceb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_name": "Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1487649, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "dbbd7b572a83b565644867c0d40cd2449a95f12f604b00c525dc4b6aa0d1a220", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "18c32ccd-b12f-4f5c-8a7d-12320ec0971e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ff3ea0434d9949316c3661b20ab02aa4fac498c99ff7da1148bc65dc84044935", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "4.3. Assistive and Emerging Technologies for Children and Adolescents with ASD on Stress Management (High-Tech and Emerging Technologies)\n\n## 4.3.1. High-Tech Wearables\n\n[80],  through  their  study,  demonstrated  a  machine  learning  approach  using  data from wearable devices to discriminate physiological states associated with stressful and non-stressful conditions in children with ASD in a controlled laboratory se tt ing, where the  heart  rate  and  resting  rate  interval  measurements  were  collected  during  rest  and during activities  designed  to  simulate  stress  using  a  consumer  (wearable)  device.  The analysis included 38 children (22 children with ASD and 16 children without ASD). After removing the outliers, 20 statistical features were explained from the data collected during the rest and stress periods of each subject. Using nested cross-validation across 76 sample periods (38 rest periods/38 stress periods), logistic regression (LR) and support vector machine (SVM) classi fi ers were trained and evaluated to classify each validation sample as a rest or stress period. The SVM and LR models achieved an accuracy of 93% and 87%, respectively. The results of the study showed that the machine learning model combined with mobile device data can support real-time health intervention applications, helping to detect and reduce stress.\n\nIn contrast to children with a language impairment (LD), the study by [95] assessed the heart rate (HR) as a possible indicator of stress reactivity in children with ASD. A total of 24 patients (mean age = 42.62 months; SD = 8.14 months) participated in the study; 12 children  with  ASD  and  12  children  with  LD  received  physiological  evaluations  (HR monitoring)  and  clinical  trials  while  donning  HR  measurement  devices  during fi ve interaction activities. An increase in HR during the third activity (ADOS-2 bubble game) was signi fi cantly  associated  with  autism  symptoms  (r  =  0.415; p =  0.044),  whereas  the association between total ADOS-2 and HR during the fi rst activity (ADOS-2 free play; r = 0. 368; p = 0.077), the second activity (baseline subscale of the Leiter-R scheme; r = 0.373; p = 0.073), and the fi fth dynamic (predicting ADOS-2 of an object procedure; r = 0.368; p = 0.076) did not quite reach statistical signi fi cance. Using a linear regression model, it was found that the total ADOS-2 score signi fi cantly in fl uenced heart rate variability ( p = 0. 023). Heart rate monitoring may provide information about stressful situations in children with\n\nASD. In addition, it may help clinicians detect the impact of stress on the core of autism and develop treatment strategies.\n\nThe E4 wristband is a portable research tool that o ff ers physiology data, analysis, and real-time imaging software. The E4 has four sensors installed to track and record the heart rate, heart rate variability, skin temperature, sympathetic nervous system activity, and blood  volume  pulses.  Studies  on  the  IBI  and  mean  heart  rate  have  demonstrated  the validity and reliability of the E4, which has been used to quantify stress and anxiety in particular populations, including the IBI [75] . In comparison to the Mindwave mobile impedance cardiography device, the study by [103] looked at the instrument's suitability as a pure research tool. Its behavior was examined through naturalistic observation that included gestures and face-to-face interaction. Thirty participants were included in the sample collection; they were connected to both devices and split into pairs to rest and converse with one another. The HRV devices' correlations ranged from modest to high, with the resting values being greater than talking ones. The E4 is unable to deliver precise EDA data, nevertheless.\n\nIn order to capture and analyze data, the Hexoskin Shirt (HS), a smart shirt with sensors that assess changes in the body's physiology, including the heart rate, respiration rate, and blood oxygen level, is connected to a health platform. In terms of the validity of Hexoskin's fi ndings, its application has primarily been assessed in groups that do not include  individuals  with  ASD,  and  it  is  generally  regarded  as  valid  and  trustworthy. Nevertheless, it poses challenges associated with connection issues that are seen during physical  activity.  In  a  recent  study,  [94]  employed  it  as  a  research  tool  to  measure physiological variations in a community of adults with ASD. Three stages of research were carried out. The HS was used in the fi rst phase to measure the physiological di ff erences between  adults  with  high-functioning  ADHD  and  those  who  were  neurotypical.  The creation of a particular machine learning algorithm to forecast challenging behavior (CB) in real time, in combination with a smartphone app that noti fi es users when CB is likely to occur, was the focus of the second phase. In the last phase, individuals with CB and their caretakers were asked to test the system's acceptability and e ffi cacy. According to the sample size estimates, 20 high-functioning individuals with ASD, aged 20 to 40, who lived at home and were part of the observation group, and 20 additional neurotypical individuals of the same age who worked in the control group were part of the fi rst phase of the study. Ten persons with ASD, ages 20 to 40, who displayed extremely violent or disruptive conduct, as well as their caregivers, were recruited for the second phase. One individual  with  ASD  who  was  between  the  ages  of  20  and  40  and  had  disruptive  or aggressive  traits  was  included  in  the fi nal  phase.  Participants  with  ASD  accepted  the usage of the SWS and did not fi nd it bothersome.\n\nUsers can learn basic social and emotional skills using Empower Me Brain Power (EMBP), available for Google Glass Explorer Edition and other smart glasses. BPS smart glasses are social communication training devices that use augmented reality. Studies on the feasibility, acceptability, safety, and clinical impact of BPS have been conducted. In particular,  EMBP glasses were used in a two-week study of a 13-year-old high school student with ASD in Massachuse tt s in order to develop an intervention targeting a tt ention issues and social learning factors that can cause anxiety in children with ASD in school educational se tt ings  [90].  Twice  daily,  the  intervention  was  given.  Participating  in  the intervention's  implementation  were  student  health  professionals,  special  education teachers, and general education teachers. Teachers' opinions, the value of technology, and its  e ff ects  on  students  and  classrooms  were  recorded  through  a  series  of  one-on-one interviews and digital journals. Both teachers and students found the use of smart glasses to be practical and easy to use, needing li tt le time for implementation or learning. Teachers also reported that pupils improved their verbal and nonverbal communication abilities\n\nand loved the experience. Furthermore, there was no indication that the technology was distracting or had a detrimental e ff ect on the classroom or other students. According to these fi ndings, social skills therapies that are given via smart glasses may be bene fi cial, realistic, and e ff ective in enhancing social communication abilities and lowering anxiety. [104] conducted a second investigation on a single individual to examine the e ffi cacy of a particular device employing EMBP. Over the course of four weeks, a technician used Brain Power  glasses  to  conduct fi fteen  intervention  sessions  in  a  private  o ffi ce.  The  subject worked  with  a  technician  who  wore  Google  Glasses  supplemented  with  arti fi cial intelligence for 15 min in each session. Measures of e ffi cacy included behavioral rating scales  with  a  pre-test  design,  qEEG  analysis,  and  a  few  neuropsychological  tests.  The results of the neuropsychological tests revealed that social cognition and face memory had signi fi cantly improved by at least one standard deviation. Changes in particular regions of  interest  that  may  be  connected  to  the  brain  areas  involved  in  the  particular neuropsychological functions assessed were found by a Z-Builder analysis. On the other hand, the instructor said that he did not notice any appreciable behavioral changes in the student.\n\n[91]  examined  the  feasibility  of  wrist-worn  sensors  for  detecting  challenging behaviors in autistic children prior to overt signs by monitoring children's heart rates, electrodermal activity, and movement, as well as the feasibility of using such sensors on the  ankle  instead  of  the  wrist  to  reduce  manual  impact  damage  and  improve  object portability through two pilot trials.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 69598, "end_char_idx": 78414, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "------------------\nMetadata:\n{metadata_str}\n\nContent:\n\n{content}\n------------------", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "18c32ccd-b12f-4f5c-8a7d-12320ec0971e": {"__data__": {"id_": "18c32ccd-b12f-4f5c-8a7d-12320ec0971e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_name": "Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1487649, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ce7a9d80-fbee-4730-9878-1fec174d5393", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_name": "Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1487649, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "a3d8457fdf1afbabe244b9e2da37b4e06a29a0f9ae05d7b3a592e767cd9f2025", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "98a0a250-55ef-41b9-b8c3-eeeb18a37aaa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_name": "Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1487649, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "ade92f2b639c0c939f62a1134443d3cb901b2992917bb7301e8bd591aa3301aa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "92e539b2-c641-4d2e-8bff-5fe650bc3f45", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dc0ccddada2434518b3f57c3e4cedbfa4121fbac07b1166eb08246f3307143a9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The fi rst trial involved a wearable sensor on the wrist of a child with autism. The second experiment studied sensors that could be worn on the wrist and ankle of a child with ASD. The results of both pilots showed that the readings from the body-worn sensors correlated with the children's behavior obtained from videos recorded during the experiment. The results showed that wearable sensors can provide additional information that can be transmi tt ed to social robots or caregivers to mitigate self-injurious behaviors.\n\n## 4.3.2. AI Machine Learning Predictors\n\n[89] examined a session in which a child with ASD interacted with various stimuli, such as a social robot that was programmed to exhibit the problematic behaviors they had noticed.  A  wearable  gadget  that  could  record  di ff erent  actions  and  physiological indications  was  worn  by  the  youngster.  To  identify  the  best  combination,  various characteristics,  and  machine  learning  setups  were  examined.  The  study's fi ndings demonstrated that, in addition to conventional kinematic measurements, physiological signals  also  result  in  more  precise  predictions.  97%  accuracy  was  a tt ained  using  the optimal feature and learning model combination. The fi ndings of this study contribute to the  development  of  early  detection  techniques  for  problematic  behaviors,  which  may enable prompt intervention by social robots and caregivers.\n\nIn their most recent study, [81], the same research team, also investigated the impact of sensors using a variety of machine learning techniques and data methods obtained from children  with  ASD  wearable  sensors  during  their  interactions  with  social  games  and robots that could identify challenging behavior. Every child wore a wearable gadget that gathered information. The occurrence of problematic behaviors was identi fi ed through the use of video comments of the sessions. To identify problematic behavior, four machine learning  algorithms  were  applied  in  conjunction  with  extracted  temporal  data  (mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum). This study also looked into variations in heart rate variability (HRV). The XGBoost algorithm achieved the best performance, with 99%  accuracy.  Furthermore,  the  physiological  features  outperformed  the  kinematic features, with the heart rate being the main  feature contributing to prediction\n\nperformance. This study highlights the importance of developing tools and methods to detect challenging behaviors in autistic children during social robot support sessions.\n\n## 4.3.3. Mobile Apps\n\nA data recording system based on mobileHCI, which employs self-assessment and physiological  signal  collecting,  was  presented  by  [79].  In  order  to  achieve  this,  the EasyConnect mobile app was created to make it simple for parents of children with ASD to document stressful situations through an online survey. A portable physiology sensor was used concurrently to gather electrodermal activity (EDA) and photoplethysmography (PPG) data. In order to determine whether physiological pa tt erns and self-reported stress were related, these signals were synced with self-reports. The fi ndings  gathered  from  eight  families  demonstrated  that  the  suggested  framework e ff ectively  facilitated  data  collection.  In  addition,  EDA-based  stress  markers  were identi fi ed and found to be connected with self-reported stress. Ten families participated, and eight of them completed the data collection. Seven females and one male (mean age (years): 44.5, SD = 3.16) were among the caregivers. The mean age (years) of the eight boys with ASD was 9.92, with a standard deviation of 1.28. The severity of ASD symptoms in children was assessed using the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2).\n\nIn  order  to  determine  whether  Anxiety  Monitor,  a  wearable,  real-time  anxiety detection device, can help children with ASD become more conscious of their anxiety symptoms  and  begin  practicing  anxiety relaxation strategies, [66] carried out a randomized controlled trial. Over the course of three sessions, twenty-eight children with ASD received instruction on how to use the Anxiety Monitor and relaxation methods for diaphragmatic breathing. On the fourth visit, participants were advised to practice deep breathing when they felt uncomfortable and were randomly assigned to either obtain feedback  on  their  anxiety  level  or  no  feedback  at  all  from  the  stress  meter  while completing a di ffi cult task (speaking in front of an audience). An increased propensity to commence deep breathing in response to stress was linked to the responses from the stress meter.\n\n## 4.3.4. Social Robots\n\nA social robot is a machine designed to interact and communicate with humans in any compatible way. Social robots are usually relatively simple in appearance, provide specialized verbal and nonverbal communication capabilities, and are commonly used in a variety of application areas. Robots can use speech, eye contact, body language, gestures, head positions, and social media to communicate with humans in situations where they exhibit predictable and unacceptable behavior, providing humans with accountability, positive feedback, and emotional release from anxiety and stress. In the literature, many social robots have been used with people with ASD. Some of those found in the literature that have been used with children with ASD to reduce anxiety include KASPAR, Kiliro, and Paro ([105,106].\n\nKiliro is a robotic parrot with 270-degree vision that is equipped with two wireless AI sphere cameras and a USB connector. It includes seven touch sensors to identify touch interactions  by  children  and  can  use  QR  codes  to  distinguish  le tt ers  and  numbers. Additionally, Kiliro is able to navigate, comprehend, and react to sounds. Regarding its application  in  children  with  anxiety  and  ASD,  [86]  employed  it  to  provide  data  on decreases  in  anxiety  symptoms  in  autistic  populations.  For  49  days,  seven  children between the ages of 6 and 16 participated in this study. One method of measuring stress was to measure the biological changes in physiology by taking samples of saliva and urine. The results following interactions with the Kiliro robot demonstrated e ff ectiveness\n\nand utility. Speci fi cally, the fi ndings of saliva and urine testing suggested that research participants' stress levels had decreased.\n\nBlow and colleagues developed the KASPAR robot in 2005 with the goal of using it as a study platform for human-robot interaction [107]. Because of its basic human form, KASPAR was used to evaluate whether it could be utilized as a therapy aid for children with ASD. It serves as a social mediator, assisting children in growing and interacting with  both  adults  and  other  children.  It  also  helps  children  build  their  foundational emotional  intelligence.  It  makes  use  of  basic  gestures,  body  language,  and  facial expressions. Additionally, without the need for outside stimulation, sensors on the face, hands, body, and feet react to touch, assisting children in learning about tactile contact and promoting socializing.\n\nTo fi nd out how well the KASPAR robot interacted with children with ASD, [92] carried out pilot research in a special school. Nine children between the ages of eight and twelve participated in a mixed-methods study using an ABAB design for this reason. A total of 36 sessions were recorded, including two sessions with the teacher (normal care) and four sessions with the KASPAR. The primary fi ndings were the teacher's responses, which were captured on videotape, and the children's small activities during the lesson. The fi ndings indicated that during the KASPAR sessions, as opposed to teacher sessions, the  children  touched  the  robot  more  frequently  than  the  teacher  ( p -value  =  0.028), replicated nonverbally more frequently ( p -value = 0.012), focused more ( p -value = 0.011), and were less distracted ( p -value = 0.021). Children gave teachers more positive verbal replies than they did for KASPAR ( p -value = 0.028). Children's spontaneous speech usage and  the  quantity  of  nonverbal  behavior  seen  both  exhibited  clinically  signi fi cant di ff erences favoring the KASPAR condition. According to the fi ndings, KASPAR is be tt er at  connecting  with  children,  holding  their  a tt ention  for  longer,  and  providing  more targeted  guidance  than  teachers.  In  addition  to  lowering  fear  and  fostering  an  ideal environment for deeper learning, the children appeared at ease and enthusiastic when interacting with the robot.\n\nUsing  KASPAR,  [93]  investigated  responses  to  anxiety  when  engaging  with  the technology. The current study set out to create a blood volume pulse (BVP) signal-based anxiety detection system for children with ASD.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 78415, "end_char_idx": 87343, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "------------------\nMetadata:\n{metadata_str}\n\nContent:\n\n{content}\n------------------", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "92e539b2-c641-4d2e-8bff-5fe650bc3f45": {"__data__": {"id_": "92e539b2-c641-4d2e-8bff-5fe650bc3f45", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_name": "Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1487649, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ce7a9d80-fbee-4730-9878-1fec174d5393", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_name": "Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1487649, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "a3d8457fdf1afbabe244b9e2da37b4e06a29a0f9ae05d7b3a592e767cd9f2025", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "18c32ccd-b12f-4f5c-8a7d-12320ec0971e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_name": "Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1487649, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "ecbf146f61e695a903ff1592d4d2c9020a73c21800e9ed1896edcc9a7b3bcf04", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bf9807cd-8ce8-4a94-82e8-cd310c17894b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "071bbec42017d237becad2660c4442ea861d39462954a778af174b27434e153b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The current study set out to create a blood volume pulse (BVP) signal-based anxiety detection system for children with ASD. In order to analyze heart rate variability for stress detection, the researchers in this study extracted the HRV features from the raw BVP signals obtained from the E4 wristband while conducting interactive research with the social robot KASPAR. Children with HRV had their facial emotions examined in order to validate the study of low- and high-frequency power features and the results. The study included twenty-one children from three di ff erent nations. The study's primary discovery was  that  the  children's  interactions  with  the  KASPAR  robot  appeared  to  lessen  their anxiety-related emotions.\n\nJapan's AIST created a robotic seal pup known as PARO. Similar to reinforcement mechanisms, autonomous mechanisms can pick up new behaviors from user feedback. With its touch, sound, vision, motion, and temperature sensors, PARO can identify what we are holding and use head, fl ap, and eye movements to convey emotions. In order to assess the e ffi cacy of assistive therapy, [84] looked at a population of individuals with ASD. To assess their mood, anxiety, and impulsivity, nine inpatient psychiatric patients, ages 8 to 19, were watched. The inpatients were allowed to engage with the robot for two months. The fi ndings were not entirely consistent. It is anticipated that this research will assist  individuals  with  ASD  in  improving  their  communication  abilities  or  lowering obsessive or nervous behaviors. However, some individuals fi nd it unfavorable due to speci fi c  features,  like  big  eyes  and  high-frequency  navigation  noise.  It  has  been demonstrated to be successful in reducing stress and anxiety symptoms in those without ASD [108,109]).\n\n## 4.3.5. Serious Games\n\nConcerning  people  with  ASD  and  stress  management,  [83],  in  their  research, examined the impact of the New Horizon game and the SpaceControl app, which were developed in collaboration with therapists and followed the empowerment principles of eHealth.  The  game  combined  two  short  games  with  relaxation  techniques.  The performance of the game was analyzed, and usability studies were conducted with three families. Parents and children were asked to complete the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS) and the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale-Parents (SCAS-P). The results showed that this game had the potential to reduce anxiety and stress in children with ASD.\n\nBy mapping the imitation and joint a tt ention (JA) subset of age-appropriate stimuli from  the  Early  Start  Denver  Model  (ESDM)  intervention,  [78]  created  GOLIAH,  an automated platform of 11 serious home intervention games, to address the need for hours of intensive intervention to treat children with this condition. A total of 14 children (ages 5  to  8)  with  ASD  and  10  controls  (matched  for  gender,  age,  region,  and  normal  care) participated in a survey in two specialized clinics, which yielded the results of 6-month matched exploratory controlled research. For six months, participants in the experimental group  had  four  30  min  GOLIAH  sessions  per  week  at  home  and  one  session  in  the hospital,  in  addition  to  their  regular  treatment.  Linear  mixed  models  were  used  for statistics. Parents and their children participated in 40% of the planned sessions and had access to all 11 games. In addition to experiencing an increase in the imitation scores on the  majority  of  imitation  games,  the  participants  who  received  GOLIAH  training  saw improvements  in  their  task  completion  times  on  the  majority  of  JA  games.  Parental anxiety index ratings were una ff ected by the GOLIAH intervention. Lastly, there were notable improvements in both groups' Vineland socialization scores, autism diagnostic observation program scores, total parental stress index scores, and issues on the child's internal, external, and overall behavior checklists.\n\n[67], through their study, investigated Emotiplay, a serious game, by conducting a cross-cultural  evaluation  (in  the  UK,  Israel,  and  Sweden).  Emotiplay  aims  to  teach emotion recognition to children with ASD in a fun way and to create internal motivation. Children with high IQs and ASD, ages 6 to 9, participated in the game for 8 to 12 weeks. Parent-reported  levels  of  autistic  symptoms  and  adaptive  socializing  were  measured, along  with  emotional  recognition  (ER)  activities,  including  face,  voice,  body,  and integrative socialization. Fifteen children in the UK were placed through tests, both before and after using serious play. Children were randomly assigned to either the waitlist or control group in Sweden ( n = 36) and Israel ( n = 38). The results from the UK indicated that 8 weeks of game use greatly enhanced participants' performance on integration, SA, and body language tests. Additionally, parents indicated that  their children were less stressed and had be tt er adaptive socialization.\n\nThe research team of [73] developed and validated a 3D serious game through virtual training that can be played to help ASD patients practice their shopping while reducing stress. Due to the need for individualized training, many aspects of this game have been adapted to enhance engagement and improve the overall e ff ectiveness. To evaluate the validity of the game, ten subjects (11.9 \u00b1 2.7 males, 20 years old) with ADHD played ten sessions of serious games once a week. Participants had practical experience before and after training in a real supermarket. Changes in the participants' daily living skills were assessed using speci fi c tools, including a form based on the International Classi fi cation of Functioning,  Disability,  and  Health  in  Children  and  Adolescents  and  the  Vineland  II Adaptive Behavior Scale. Signi fi cant improvements ( p &lt; 0.05) were found in basic skills acquired through serious game play, particularly in understanding the purchase process, a tt ention direction, and problem-solving skills. These results suggest that personalized serious games may be an important tool for improving daily living skills.\n\nAccording to  [71],  201  families-parents  and  children-participated  in  the  study. Three steps were  incorporated in the mixed  research design employed  in  this investigation. Depending on their diagnoses (ASD, ADHD, or neurotypical), participants were randomized to one of three intervention groups: serious play, parental support, or a combination of serious play and parental support. Following that, routine scores, obtained at  three  time  intervals  (baseline,  mean,  and  endurance)  throughout  an  8-week  period, were  analyzed  using  latent  growth  modeling  and  repeated  ANOVAs.  The fi ndings indicated that a diagnosis had a moderate impact on the children's daily routine. Two interventions  (parental  support  alone  and  a  combination  of  serious  play  and  parental support) showed very large clinical e ff ects for participants with ADHD, while only one treatment (a combination of serious play and parental support) showed this e ff ect  for children with ASD.\n\n## 4.3.6. Virtual Reality\n\nVR technology provides digital installations that promote virtual immersion through electronic visual simulation, immersing users in an engaging 3D world full of sensory cues and emotions. As virtual reality becomes increasingly popular as an educational tool in learning environments, there are growing expectations about its e ff ectiveness with people with  disabilities.  Virtual reality  provides  a  fun,  safe,  controlled,  and  motivating educational  environment  and  can  be  an  engaging  intervention  for  people  with  ASD. Virtual reality educational applications have shown promising results in this regard [110].\n\nConcerning their use to combat stress in children and adolescents with ASD, their use seems to be increasingly explored by researchers. More speci fi cally, in the study by [111], the researchers used a sample of nine boys aged 7 to 13 years old who were verbal and diagnosed with ASD but without learning di ffi culties to create and evaluate a novel treatment using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and gradual exposure to a virtual reality environment (VRE). Every child was interested in a particular subject. In addition to increasing the child's exposure to the phobia or phobic stimulus as necessary, the VRE participants  received  behavioral  and  cognitive  therapy  from  a  psychologist,  such  as breathing exercises. For each child, four sessions lasting 20 to 30 min each were planned. Four participants fully conquered their fear, while eight of the nine children in the study were eventually able to regulate their phobias. The treatment's e ff ects persisted after a year.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 87220, "end_char_idx": 96100, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "------------------\nMetadata:\n{metadata_str}\n\nContent:\n\n{content}\n------------------", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf9807cd-8ce8-4a94-82e8-cd310c17894b": {"__data__": {"id_": "bf9807cd-8ce8-4a94-82e8-cd310c17894b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_name": "Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1487649, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ce7a9d80-fbee-4730-9878-1fec174d5393", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_name": "Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1487649, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "a3d8457fdf1afbabe244b9e2da37b4e06a29a0f9ae05d7b3a592e767cd9f2025", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "92e539b2-c641-4d2e-8bff-5fe650bc3f45", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_name": "Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1487649, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "3b46abf7b752f8d2437c6a503e252220a2abe70bc6e1895590659d48c3d28b7b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ab662abf-a3fa-4b5e-808b-ca2607a53721", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f59be22ce4caf0d1696ca3ef2cecd667c48486d6933538dc5be219548eb30737", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Four participants fully conquered their fear, while eight of the nine children in the study were eventually able to regulate their phobias. The treatment's e ff ects persisted after a year. These fi ndings demonstrated that CBT, in conjunction with AER, can be a highly successful treatment for phobias, anxiety, or a speci fi c type of fear in certain young people with ASD.\n\nIn a dentistry clinic, [98] study sought to determine how well VR distraction worked to lower anxiety and behavior in children with ASD. A total of 68 children between the ages of 8 and 15 who needed routine, non-invasive dental care and had an ASD diagnosis were enrolled in this study. During two appointments spaced three months apart, these children received routine, painless dental care. At each visit, the children were given the Frankel Behavioral Rating Scale and the Venham imaging test to gauge their dental and behavioral  anxiety  following  treatment.  Forty  children  received  dental  treatment,  and data collection and an analysis of the results were subsequently completed. When using VR distraction, patients' reported anxiety scores signi fi cantly decreased, and their dental behavior improved equally signi fi cantly ( p = 0.042 and p = 0.0001, respectively). The results showed that VR distraction can help children with ASD who receive routine dental care.\n\nAn  interactive  virtual  reality  game  called  SoundFields  was  used  by  [70]  in  their research,  using  exposure-based  therapeutic  techniques  targeting  auditory  stimulation through binaural spatial sounds. In order to assess the e ffi cacy of SoundFields in lowering anxiety related to the chosen distracting noises, an experiment was carried out on six children and adolescents with ASD, ages 16 to 19, who showed hyper-responsiveness to\n\nparticular sounds. Throughout the four weeks of the trial, every participant engaged in active  VR  game  play.  Signi fi cant  decreases  in  anxiety  levels  related  to  the  targeted auditory stimuli were found when pre- and post-survey data were compared. According to the study's fi ndings, SoundFields could help individuals with ASD manage their aural hypersensitivity.\n\nThe City University of Hong Kong's Centre for Applied Innovation in Internet and Multimedia Technology (AIMTech Center) created six virtual reality training scenarios that mirrored the everyday lives of typical Hong Kong children in order to test the e ffi cacy of a VR-based educational program on emotional and social skills. Ninety-four students with ASD from Hong Kong's general primary schools took part in the study, and 72 of them were included for analysis. The children in the training group were more engaged in social issues, had be tt er adjustment after training (M = 21.8, SD = 2. 99) than before training  (M  =  20.2,  SD  =  3.43,  t  (35)  = -3.987, p &lt;  0.0005),  and  had  higher  emotional expression and regulation (M = 20.2, SD = 3.00) than before training (M = 18.9, SD = 3.57, t (35) = -2.174, p = 0. 037). Additionally, for emotional expressions (F (1, 70) = 5.223, p = 0.025, partial \u03b7 2 = 0.069) and social reciprocity (F (1, 70) = 7.769, p = 0.007, partial \u03b7 2 = 0.100), there was a statistically signi fi cant interaction between the group and time. Children were able to participate in virtual reality training despite initial di ffi culties associated with the glasses.  Some  children  declined  to  participate  for  programming  reasons,  which  could have been minimized by using a head-mounted monitor as a portable and cost-e ff ective device. The results summarized that virtual reality appears to be a promising addition to traditional education and therapy by aiding emotional regulation by reducing stress in children  with  ASD [72].  These  six  scenarios  were  put  to  the  test  by  the  same  team  of researchers  [65]  in  a  similar  experimental  study  that  used  virtual  reality  to  address emotional control in children with  ASD.  With  corresponding  psychoeducational procedures and protocols, six distinct learning scenarios were created, including one that facilitated  reinforcement  and  conceptual  generalization,  four  that  simulated  di ff erent social situations, and one that focused on relaxation and emotional control techniques. Children  were  shown  the  learning  scenarios  in  a  four-view  interactive  virtual  reality environment with non-intrusive motion tracking, also known as half-CAVE. The 14-week, 28-session program involved 94 children with a clinical diagnosis of ASD, ages 6 to 12. When comparing  the  tests  conducted  before  and  after  training,  the  study  found  that children's emotional expression and regulation, as well as the emotional reciprocity of social emotions, had signi fi cantly improved.\n\nThe preliminary  experimental study  by  [100]  examined  the  application  of  virtual reality-based functional communication in fi ve children diagnosed with ASD using an iPhone X and a Google Cardboard device, conducting a VR intervention at a frequency of once  a  week  for  3  weeks  for  each  participant.  In  these  interventions,  the  researchers measured the ability to perform an activity on a four-point scale. During the fourth week, all children participated in a realistic fl ight rehearsal at San Diego International Airport. Parents were asked to rate their child's ability to travel by airplane before the fi rst week and after the fourth week. All children improved their airport travel skills from pre- to post-intervention, according to the researchers' and parents' observations. All children were able to move independently at the airport, showing reduced stress in the process.\n\n[96] examined VR use in a classroom of 31 children with ASD aged 6-16 years by examining  the subjects' perceptions of their use  through  mixed  methodological approaches.  The  results  showed  that  costly  and  technologically  advanced  VRs  were preferred,  more  speci fi cally,  the  HTC  Vive;  also,  users  described  them  as  enjoyable, physically and visually comfortable, easy to use, and exciting, wanting to use them again. They also highlighted the bene fi cial e ff ects of VR, including relaxation/feeling calm, the ability to virtually explore a place before visiting it in the real world, and the development\n\nof  learning  opportunities  at  school.  Figure  5  summarizes  all  the fi ndings  of  the technologies used.\n\nFigure 5. Low and high technologies combating stress.\n\n## 4.4. Measurement Tools Used\n\nStudies employed a wide range of measurement tools to evaluate stress and anxiety in children and adolescents with ASD. All these measurement tools can be categorized in six key areas, including physiological biomarkers, behavioral observations, psychological and  self-reported  measures,  cognitive  and  emotional  performance  metrics,  sensory processing assessments, as well as machine learning-based prediction metrics.\n\nPhysiological  biomarkers  were  found  to  be  used  to  evaluate  autonomic  stress responses. HR and HRV were tracked via wearable devices to determine stress-related changes  in  ANS.  [80]  and  [66],  in  their  studies  used  HR  monitoring  as  a  primary physiological measure, and [81] integrated HR tracking with interbeat interval analysis for stress prediction. EDA and skin conductance in several studies were utilized as key factors to measure sympathetic nervous system activation [75,79]). EDA was also useful in identifying elevated stress responses in real-time se tt ings. Furthermore, cortisol and salivary  biomarkers were employed in studies like [68] and [69] to identify endocrine stress responses pre- and post-intervention.\n\nRegarding behavioral observations, they were utilized to capture an understanding of  the  engagement  and  social  interaction  of  individuals  related  to  stressors.  More speci fi cally  [87]  and  [88]  applied  naturalistic  observations  to  assess  engagement  in classroom and structure work systems' e ff ectiveness. Others, like [92] and [81], performed more in-depth micro-behavioral analysis using video tracking and motion data in their studies. These approaches are used to analyze verbal social behaviors, a tt ention shifts, and motor pa tt erns in robot -assisted and interactive interventions.\n\nPsychological  and  self-reported  measures  were  utilized  to  capture  subjective experiences of stress and anxiety. Studies like [74] and [79] gathered parent and caregiver reports using structured logs to track stress levels, mostly in natural se tt ings. Similarly, [97] and [73] evaluated parental perceptions of intervention e ff ectiveness in improving emotional regulation and adaptive behaviors.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 95911, "end_char_idx": 104652, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "------------------\nMetadata:\n{metadata_str}\n\nContent:\n\n{content}\n------------------", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ab662abf-a3fa-4b5e-808b-ca2607a53721": {"__data__": {"id_": "ab662abf-a3fa-4b5e-808b-ca2607a53721", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_name": "Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1487649, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ce7a9d80-fbee-4730-9878-1fec174d5393", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_name": "Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1487649, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "a3d8457fdf1afbabe244b9e2da37b4e06a29a0f9ae05d7b3a592e767cd9f2025", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bf9807cd-8ce8-4a94-82e8-cd310c17894b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_name": "Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1487649, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "ffa783aa6923213027d5ce6f92e4bc8e2041143862d6c109eaee30dff4993ee5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f55bdfba-f21c-4a14-bd22-ff688760281b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "faec6149c70bef5db7d8e0ffb4871b2229036c03e3488569415d5456466be364", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Similarly, [97] and [73] evaluated parental perceptions of intervention e ff ectiveness in improving emotional regulation and adaptive behaviors. Self-reported anxiety measures, just like SCAS used in [83], gathered data on a child's perceived anxiety changes.\n\nRelated  to  cognitive  and  emotional  performance,  studies  focusing  on  social  and emotional  learning  interventions  basically  evaluated  emotion  recognition  and  social adaption via validated cognitive measures. More speci fi cally, [67] utilized face, body, and voice emotion recognition tasks, while [72] examined measuring a ff ective expressions and social reciprocity using PEP-3 assessments. Others, like [78] and [88], examined executive functions and cognitive load by integrating them into their interventions involving visual schedules  and  serious  games.  More  speci fi cally,  they  analyzed  the  reaction  times  in imitation tasks as well as cognitive load reduction in classroom se tt ings.\n\nAccording to sensory processing and adaptation measures, most of the researchers used sensory pro fi les and physiological responses to stimuli. Speci fi cally, [97] used SPQ 2 to  examine fi dget  toys'  e ff ectiveness  in  reducing  anxiety,  and  [99]  measured  auditory sensitivity reduction through the GAS T-scores. [77] used EEG-based neural monitoring to evaluate adaptive auditory processing responses to stress that was related to adaptive behavior  RAAT,  and  VABS-II  was  utilized  by  [71]  and  [73],  accordingly,  to  evaluate functional skills and real-life behavioral improvements.\n\nFinally, several studies employed AI and machine learning models to predict stress and challenging behaviors. [80], as well as [94], utilized classi fi cation models to detect physiological stress pa tt erns, presenting high accuracy (AUC &gt; 0.70). Also, [89] used an XGBoost  model,  achieving  99%  accuracy  in  stress  prediction.  Aside  from  the  strong demonstration of predictive power, further validation in real-life scenarios is required to con fi rm their long-term application (Figure 6).\n\nFigure 6. Stress-related measurement tools used across studies.\n\n## 4.5. E ff ect Sizes Among Technologies\n\nThe  present  systematic  review  of n =  36  studies  revealed  important fi ndings regarding  the  e ff ectiveness  of  stress  and  anxiety  reduction  among  children  and adolescents with ASD. The results produced a broad spectrum of e ff ect sizes, with some interventions demonstrating strong and signi fi cant improvements while others reported modes or inconsistent e ff ects. There was also a signi fi cant number of studies that did not explicitly report the e ff ect sizes, creating a critical gap in methodological standardization.\n\nAccording  to  the  studies  analyzed,  the  most  e ff ective  were  those  that  provided wearable biofeedback and AI-driven stress detection technologies, demonstrating strong statistically  signi fi cant  e ff ects  [66,79,81].  VR  interventions  produced  shared  similar fi ndings  and  presented  strong  e ff ects,  mostly  in  improving  emotional  regulation  and stress resilience [71,79]. Moderate to large e ff ect sizes were also found in social robotics interventions, supporting their potential for improving social engagement and emotional regulation [67,92]. On the contrary, low-tech assistive technology solutions demonstrated\n\nmoderate e ff ect sizes, as they were less consistent across di ff erent populations and se tt ings in using interventions like weighted blankets [74,87], visual schedules [88], and VR-based distraction techniques [98]. Nonetheless, several studies did not provide explicit e ff ect size calculations  and  were  based  on  qualitative  evaluations,  descriptive  statistics,  as  well signi fi cance testing without standardized measures of impact magnitude [69,70,84,85,91,93,94,97,99].\n\nAnother issue noticed in most of the studies was the limited diversity surrounding the pool of participants. Many studies demonstrated an overreliance on male participants, presenting an imbalance between male and female subjects. [77] used n = 75 boys and only n = 8 girls, showcasing unclear results if the e ff ect of auditory interventions was similar across genders.\n\n## 5. Discussion\n\nThe results of this study bring together and demonstrate the bene fi ts and potential of emerging and assistive technologies to reduce neurophysiological stress and anxiety in children and adolescents with ASD and SMD by highlighting both the e ff ectiveness and limitations  of  these  technological  interventions.  The  present  research  identi fi es  several assistive and emerging technologies that have shown positive e ff ects in reducing anxiety in children with ASD, also o ff ering a unique insight by analysis of various e ffi cacies across di ff erent types of technologies (low and high). To the best of our knowledge, this is the fi rst study that collected data and analyzed the whole scope of technologies used (low and high), speci fi cally for targeting stress and anxiety in children and adolescents with ASD, providing valuable pieces of information that can be utilized by researchers for future studies, as well as specialists and educators who work with children and adolescents with ASD and their caregivers.

showed similar bene fi ts.\n\nMore  speci fi cally,  low-tech  interventions  showed  moderate  e ff ects  in  reducing anxiety-related  behaviors  by  supporting  individuals  with  sensory  regulation  and predictability  [76,88].  Aside  from  the  cost-e ff ectiveness  as  well  as  availability  and usability, their fi ndings were related to several inconsistencies found in several studies [74,87]. On the contrary, high and emerging technology interventions showcased more potential and accuracy in the real-time detection of stress by identifying high-accuracy physiological markers, thus providing feedback for real-time interventions [66,80,94]. AIbased technologies [112],  including  machine  learning  models  trained  on  physiological data,  have  proven  to  be  highly  e ff ective  in  predicting  stress-related  behaviors  in  ASD individuals [81,89], showing their growing potential in preventing anxiety episodes and meltdowns. VR-based interventions showcased (in most of the studies) positive e ff ects in improving social skills and emotional regulation [72] while decreasing anxiety levels [70]. Mobile apps were found helpful, providing users with accessible and friendly environments to reduce stress levels and help them to self-report and monitor their state by themselves or their caregivers [66,79]. Similar fi ndings were also identi fi ed by the use of Serious Games, which reported a positive impact on emotional regulation and daily routines,  especially  when  they  were  used  in  combination  with  parental  support, showcasing  a  reduction  in  stress-related  behaviors  [71].  In  addition,  parents  reported positive  e ff ects  on  autism  symptoms  in  social  reciprocity  and  adaptability  while improving their emotion recognition and socializing skills [67]. Finally, social robots were found to be e ff ective in improving social interaction by reducing stress levels in children with ASD [86,92].", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 377648, "end_char_idx": 431581, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "------------------\nMetadata:\n{metadata_str}\n\nContent:\n\n{content}\n------------------", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a358f482-052e-472b-8d06-852838ec952f": {"__data__": {"id_": "a358f482-052e-472b-8d06-852838ec952f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_name": "Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1487649, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ce7a9d80-fbee-4730-9878-1fec174d5393", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_name": "Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1487649, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "a3d8457fdf1afbabe244b9e2da37b4e06a29a0f9ae05d7b3a592e767cd9f2025", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a8f89836-7a21-45d4-b740-a77f11bf1687", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_name": "Assistive_and_Emerging_Technologies_to_D.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1487649, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "51fa2d14c2a0466ee13794d0519f7bcb11c4b54abcf174a43227f184b64ca3f9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "992f0f8b-0e0f-432e-bd37-b2e40e4a7ec5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a1bdcbc2172df2e39ef0ae5108ecb931c7a874ffc1f0749eb9ed09031e0654c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Finally, social robots were found to be e ff ective in improving social interaction by reducing stress levels in children with ASD [86,92].\n\nDespite the positive e ff ects presented in most of the studies about stress and anxiety reduction as well as detection, several limitations were identi fi ed. More speci fi cally, these limitations are related to methodological, technological, participant-related, and longitudinal factors. One of the main limitations reported in a number of studies was the small  sample  sizes,  having  a  negative  impact  on  statistical  power  as  well  as  the generalizability of the results. For instance, [87] had one participant, and [81] had only a sample of fi ve children. Furthermore, in several studies [74,95], high dropout rates were identi fi ed,  reaching  55,6%.  In  addition,  other  studies  lacked  randomized  controlled designs, relying only on single-subject feasibility or pilot studies [66,79]. Last but not least, the  short  duration  of  many  interventions  made  it  di ffi cult  to  evaluate  their  true e ff ectiveness [85,86,98].\n\nAccording  to  emerging  technologies,  many  of  the  studies  showcased  promising results  but  also  presented  several  limitations  due  to  technical  issues,  user  discomfort, device  limitations,  as  well  as  data  accuracy.  More  speci fi cally,  wearable  sensors,  VR interventions,  and  smart  wearable  shirts  presented  discomfort  [66,79],  di ffi culty  with wearing  the  equipment  [72],  as  well  as  technical  inconsistencies  like  Bluetooth  and internet connectivity, a ff ecting real-time data collection. Furthermore, data accuracy and algorithm issues were other factors limiting the results, apart from succeeding in highaccuracy levels in stress prediction (up to 99%). Regarding [80] and [81], their studies were performed only in control lab se tt ings. [93] also presented fi ndings that made it unclear how biometric stress markers were presented in various sessions. Furthermore, another phenomenon  observed  in  many  studies  was  the  overreliance on male  subjects, showcasing results that cannot be interpreted without creating gender imbalance issues.\n\n[77] included n = 75 boys and only n = 8 girls in their samples, making it unclear whether auditory interventions have the same e ff ects across genders. Meanwhile, [66] presented similar fi ndings between experimental groups regarding IQ and gender. No follow-up measurements were also another factor, thus limiting the sustainability of the intervention e ff ects.  Most  of  the  studies  only  measured  outcomes  immediately  post-intervention without measuring the long-term e ff ects [66,71,72,88],.\n\n## 6. Conclusions\n\nAlthough the fi ndings of this present study are quite encouraging for the application of these technologies in the daily lives of individuals, several limitations were identi fi ed that  hinder  the  reliability,  validity,  and  generalizability  of  the  results.  Moreover,  high diversity was identi fi ed concerning the samples tested. ASD, as it is known, presents a wide  range,  and  the  samples  tested  showed  high  heterogeneity  (ranging  from  low, average, and high functionality, as well as di ff erent sensory processing pro fi les of stimuli), making it di ffi cult to generalize the results.\n\nRegarding the use of these aids in se tt ings such as schools and communities, issues concerning the acceptance and appropriate training of a teacher, therapist, as well as the community itself must be ensured. Cost is another factor that should be considered and is not mentioned in most of the included studies. Also, the majority of the technological tools used  in  these  studies  (especially  those  that  are  high-tech  tools)  are  not  accessible  nor available to the general public, assuming that not every socio-economic group can a ff ord to purchase them because they are not provided by the state. Furthermore, the majority of  the  reported  technological  devices  require  specialization  and  considerable  time  in training caregivers and users themselves to become familiar with their use. Regarding the methodological  elements  of  the  included  studies,  several  limitations  were  identi fi ed regarding the small sample size, which may lead to a type two methodological error, where real e ff ects are not detected, thus preventing the generalizability of the results to the wider population. In addition, most of the studies did not include a control sample and were short in duration (from a few weeks to months), hindering access to long-term changes and making the task of creating speci fi c forms of intervention more di ffi cult. Also, shortcomings were identi fi ed in terms of reviewing the data to be able to see if the bene fi ts observed are long-lasting. Finally, an emerging fi eld on gut-microbiome interactions was not identi fi ed in any type of study related to the use of any type of technology yet.\n\nBased on the fi ndings of this study, the following observations are noted for future research to improve the methodological factors and to create universal intervention plans in the physical environments of people with ASD experiencing stress.\n\nInitially,  the  long-term  impact  of  the  changes  observed  from  the  use  of  these technologies should be studied. To this end, it is imperative to use experimental models that examine their use over time. In addition, emphasis should be placed on personalizing the needs of each individual. Personalization seems to have a positive e ff ect on the results of the interventions. Also, research should delve into how to build these technologies so that they are more user-friendly. Finally, adequate training should be provided to the user and the person's carers to ensure maximum results.\n\nAuthor  Contributions: Conceptualization  P.P.;  methodology,  P.P.;  software,  P.P.  and  V.B.; validation,  P.P.,  V.B.,  A.D.

Children with clinically significant feeding difficulties on the BPFAS ( n = 55, 68.8%) had higher levels of caregiver-reported impact on daily activities, worry and feeding difficulties compared to children without clinically significant feeding difficulties (FS-IS; U = 257.000, z = /C0 4.471, p &lt; 0.01). Spearman's rank correlation showed a statistically significant, moderate correlation between BPFAS total frequency score and FSIS Daily activities score, rs (98) = 0.56, p &lt; 0.01, indicating that as the frequency of feeding difficulties increased, the impact of these feeding difficulties on caregivers also increased. Using multiple regression, a model comprising of the three factors was statistically significant ( F [1, 78] = 87.75, p &lt; 0.001, adj. R 2 = 0.52), with children's frequency of feeding difficulties the strongest predictor of caregiver-reported impact with a moderate effect size ( r = 0.49).\n\nConclusion: Autistic children's feeding difficulties had a greater impact on caregivers than autism or sensory profiles, with the frequency of feeding difficulties and the caregiver impact of these feeding difficulties positively correlated. The findings demonstrate that efforts to understand and address feeding difficulties in autistic children must extend beyond the children to include their families.\n\n## KEYWORDS\n\nautism, caregivers, feeding difficulties, mealtimes, paediatrics\n\nThis is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n\n\u00a92024 The Authors.

Autistic children are five times more likely than non-autistic peers to have reported feeding concerns (Sharp et al., 2013) with an estimated prevalence of 46 -89% (Ledford &amp; Gast, 2006). The term feeding difficulties is an overarching term describing a range of difficulties related to food refusal, limited appetite, oral motor and/or swallowing difficulties (Milano et al., 2019). Pediatric Feeding Disorder (PFD) is an umbrella term proposed via expert consensus (Goday et al., 2019) and diagnoses based on a combination of clinical assessment and caregiver report (Dharmaraj et al., 2023). No direct clinical assessment was used in this study; thus, the term ' feeding difficulties ' will be used throughout, acknowledging that many of these children may have PFD.\n\nExisting research reports that autistic children's sensory profiles can contribute to their feeding difficulties (Boudjarane et al., 2017; Page et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2020) and that they are more likely to have a limited range of food (Bandini et al., 2010) with fewer fruits and vegetables (Bandini et al., 2010; Schreck et al., 2004) and higher carbohydrates (Schreck et al., 2004; Suarez &amp; Crinion, 2015) in their diet. Furthermore, their reduced dietary variety, food neophobia and need for sameness has been positively correlated with the diagnostic criteria of restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviours, interests or activities (EntenVissoker, 2021; Hubbard et al., 2014; Suarez &amp; Crinion, 2015). Yet, while the potential impact of feeding difficulties on autistic children's health and wellbeing is clear, the potential impact of these feeding difficulties on caregivers in relation to supporting their children at mealtimes is not well understood.\n\nThe importance of caregiver well-being in raising autistic children is well established, particularly given the additional stressors that many caregivers experience. For example, caregivers of autistic children have higher demands placed on them related to caring for their autistic children including attending additional health professional appointments (Davy et al., 2022; DePape &amp; Lindsay, 2015). Davy et al. (2022) highlighted the impact on caregivers' quality of life, which influenced their own social participation levels for leisure, community access and employment. Yet caregiver wellbeing is often overlooked in the context of an autistic child's feeding difficulties despite the known impacts that feeding difficulties can have on family dynamics (Marshall et al., 2014; Meral &amp; Fidan, 2015; Zhu &amp; Dalby-Payne, 2019) and parental stress (McStay et al., 2014). Further understanding of autistic children's feeding and relationship to the caregiver impact of these feeding difficulties and resulting wellbeing is required.\n\nThe influence of autism severity on caregiver stress has been explored in the literature. McStay et al. (2014) used caregiver rating scales to explore parental stress in children aged 6 -19 years of age. They found that caregiver stress was higher for children with higher levels of hyperactivity even when children's age, verbal ability and symptom severity were taken into consideration. However, more\n\n## Key messages\n\n- Autistic children can experience feeding difficulties that may impact not only their own health and wellbeing but also that of their caregiver-child dynamics at mealtimes.\n- Variability in presentation of feeding difficulties for autistic children highlights the need for individualisation in assessment and therapy.\n- Health professionals should consider providing support to caregivers as well as treating feeding difficulties in autistic children.\n- Considerations at a policy level need to be made around supporting caregivers with managing stress and worry related to supporting their children with their feeding.\n- Future co-designed research with the autistic community using a strengths-based approach will support more translatable research findings.\n\nrecent research exploring child predictors on caregiver strain and well-being has highlighted that it can be a combination of behaviours including hyperactivity as well as autism severity that can contribute to caregiver reported stress (Bradshaw et al., 2021). Such variability points to the need for a better understanding of autism severity and its relationship with caregivers and mealtimes.\n\nThe relationship between behaviour and sensory profiles on caregiver stress has been well researched with findings suggesting that autistic children's sensory processing differences can increase caregiver stress (Griffin et al., 2022; Kirby et al., 2019). There is also evidence that confirms children's sensory profiles can influence all areas of family daily life including mealtime routines (Bagby et al., 2012) demonstrating the need to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of autistic children's sensory profiles and feeding difficulties on caregiver stress.\n\nDespite the complex underlying reasons behind feeding difficulties, few studies have explored the relative impact of children's autistic characteristics, sensory profiles and feeding difficulties on caregiver impact. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of three child-related factors (children's autism characteristics, sensory profiles and feeding difficulties) on caregivers' experiences of supporting their autistic children at mealtimes. The specific aims were to (a) examine the nature of feeding difficulties in autistic children, (b) examine the relationship between feeding difficulties and caregiver-reported feeding impact and (c) determine whether children's feeding difficulties predicted caregiver impact, over autism characteristics and sensory profiles. Based on clinical cases and impact studies exploring feeding difficulties in medically complex children, we hypothesised that the frequency of children's feeding difficulties would be a unique predictor of caregiver impact, and there would be a relationship between the frequency of children's reported feeding difficulties and caregiver impact.\n\n## 2 | METHODS\n\n## 2.1 | Design\n\nAn online survey design was used to address the research questions and was open for a period of 6 months (October 2021 to April 2022).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 9897, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "------------------\nMetadata:\n{metadata_str}\n\nContent:\n\n{content}\n------------------", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "df2fe0b8-50c4-43f5-ad74-045fd8da3645": {"__data__": {"id_": "df2fe0b8-50c4-43f5-ad74-045fd8da3645", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Child - 2024 - Gent - Investigating the impact of autistic children s feeding difficulties on caregivers.pdf", "file_name": "Child - 2024 - Gent - Investigating the impact of autistic children s feeding difficulties on caregivers.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 673957, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a5803c19-c299-47ed-a6e4-76c1faac8b21", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Child - 2024 - Gent - Investigating the impact of autistic children s feeding difficulties on caregivers.pdf", "file_name": "Child - 2024 - Gent - Investigating the impact of autistic children s feeding difficulties on caregivers.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 673957, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "00637a3b7503e65a06f05d36e20f2caac564e1c3c2506bbf0b2dd3cf9c944047", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7aa04fd6-ad37-4107-80b1-900880bae0f0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Child - 2024 - Gent - Investigating the impact of autistic children s feeding difficulties on caregivers.pdf", "file_name": "Child - 2024 - Gent - Investigating the impact of autistic children s feeding difficulties on caregivers.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 673957, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "90c740938a83093499984404c68cfc28304249989278c777bc9d63e772ed46a8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4f609c81-d9c1-4a80-8ad6-a4b9d4fa659f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e6f5ee6be4ffa3079073cfe7bb84250f6ae97bb64c40439363341d136e78f6bd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "## 2 | METHODS\n\n## 2.1 | Design\n\nAn online survey design was used to address the research questions and was open for a period of 6 months (October 2021 to April 2022). The method and findings are reported in accordance with the ' Checklist for reporting results of internet e-surveys ' , CHERRIES (Eysenbach, 2004).\n\n## 2.2 | Survey development\n\nThe online survey was designed and delivered in two sections comprising of tools that examined children's autism characteristics, sensory profiles and the nature of their feeding difficulties. Permission was obtained to include published and copyrighted tools.\n\n## 2.2.1 | Autism characteristics\n\nThe Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ; Rutter, 2003) ' current form ' was used to assess children's autism characteristics. It comprises of 40 yes/no questions relating to children's behaviour over the most recent 3-month period; it is suitable for children aged \u2265 4 years and has been shown to identify differences between non-autistic children and autistic children in a school-aged population cohort (Chandler et al., 2007). The SCQ yields a total score out of 39 points, with a cut-off of \u2265 11 associated with a diagnosis of Autism (Chandler et al., 2007). The SCQ total raw score was used as a measure of autism characteristics in the analysis.\n\n## 2.2.2 | Sensory profiles\n\nThe Sensory Profile 2 -Short form (SSP-2; Dunn, 2014) was used to assess the children's sensory profiles includes 34 questions about children's behavioural responses to sensory stimuli (seeking, avoiding, sensitivity and registration) and has been used to identify differences in sensory subtypes in autistic children (Simpson et al., 2019). The SSP-2 sensory processing total raw score was used to account for sensory profiles in the analysis.\n\n## 2.2.3 | Feeding difficulties\n\nThe Behavioral Pediatric Feeding Assessment Scale (BPFAS; Crist &amp; Napier-Phillips, 2001) was used to assess the frequency of feeding behaviours and the caregiver's feelings towards these. It comprises of 35 questions, has good test -retest reliability (Crist et al., 1994; Sanchez et al., 2015) and has demonstrated assessment efficacy in autistic children with feeding difficulties (Allen et al., 2015; Peverill et al., 2019; Zlomke et al., 2020). The test yields a problem and frequency score with higher scores representing more problematic mealtime behaviours. Scores above 84 on the total frequency scale (TFS) indicate that a child presents with clinically significant feeding difficulties, and scores above 9 on the total problem score (TPS) indicate that these mealtime behaviours present a concern to the family (related to severity of the problem). Both scores were used in the analysis to explore the frequency of feeding difficulties (TFS) and level of caregiver concern present (TPS).\n\n## 2.2.4 | Feeding impact\n\nThe Feeding/Swallowing -Impact Survey (FS-IS; Lefton-Greif et al., 2014) was used to assess the impact of feeding on the caregiver and includes 18 items using a Likert scale across three subscales exploring quality-of-life (QoL) in relation to activities of feeding (six items), daily living (five items) and general worry (seven items) with lower scores suggesting a higher QoL. FS-IS has adequate validity in the assessment of QoL for caregivers of children with feeding difficulties (Lefton-Greif et al., 2014). The FS-IS total score was used in the analysis to explore the caregiver reported impact of having a child with feeding difficulties while the FS-IS daily activities score was used to understand the impact of increasing feeding difficulties on caregivers' daily lives. All three FS-IS subscales (feeding, daily living and general worry) were used to measure the caregiver impact against the frequency of feeding difficulties (as measured by the BPFAS).\n\n## 2.3 | Participants\n\nStudy participants included 78 caregivers of 80 autistic children. Participants were initially recruited through purposeful sampling by contacting health professionals who work with autistic children. Providers were informed about the study and asked to invite families who fit the eligibility criteria. Inclusion criteria included caregivers of children aged 5 -12 years with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder from a medical professional using the criteria described in the Diagnostic Statistical Manual -5th edition, text revision (DSM-5 TR) (American Psychiatric Association, APA, 2022) or Diagnostic Statistical Manual -4th edition (DSM-IV) (APA, 2013). Participants were notified that the survey was open to all caregivers, including those who spoke English as their second language. However, it was outlined that the online survey was in English and an interpreter or translated copies of the survey were not available through the research team. Recruitment was extended by inviting caregivers of autistic children to participate via social media (e.g., Facebook autism parent groups) who were then required to confirm that their children had an Autism diagnosis in their consent forms. Participants were invited to ask questions prior to providing informed consent. A follow-up survey was sent after the study closed to gain additional demographic information because of an oversight with not including these questions in the original survey. Seventy-seven of 78 caregivers (98.72%) were mothers and approximately half (51.28%) aged between 30 and 39 years (Table 1).\n\nTABLE 1 Demographic characteristics: Caregivers of autistic children ( n = 78).\n\n| Characteristics                                 | N (%)        |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Number of caregivers                            | 78           |\n| Number of surveys completed                     | 80           |\n| Gender                                          |              |\n| Female                                          | 77 (98.72%)  |\n| Male                                            | 1 (1.25%)    |\n| Age                                             |              |\n| 20 -

A large proportion of the sample (83.75%) reported co-occurring diagnoses, which two authors (VG and KW) classified according to the International Classification of Diseases 11th revision (ICD-11). Thirty-five per cent of the children had two co-occurring diagnoses in the ICD categories of Mental and Behavioural disorders (e.g., Anxiety and ADHD) and\n\nDiseases of the nervous system (e.g., Epilepsy and Cerebral Palsy) with most of these diagnoses made by clinical psychologists as per caregiver report (66.25%). Fifty per cent of the cohort had a co-occurring diagnosis of ADHD, and 34 % had anxiety (see Tables S1 and S2).\n\n## 2.4 | Analysis\n\nDescriptive statistics were used to examine the demographic data and proportion of children who presented with clinically significant feeding difficulties as measured by the BPFAS total frequency score (cut of &gt;84). Non-parametric testing was used, as data were not normally distributed. Mann Whitney-U tests were used to determine if the impact on families (measured by the FS-IS Total score) was greater in children with clinically feeding difficulties as compared those without feeding difficulties (as measured by the BPFAS TFS). The TFS was chosen to ensure that there was no overlap between the predictors of caregiver impact and feeding difficulties. A Spearman's correlation test, rather than Pearson's correlation, was used to examine the relationship between the discrete ordinal variables, frequency of feeding difficulties on the BPFAS and the impact of feeding difficulties on the family in the FS-IS. Multiple linear regression was used to examine whether the frequency of feeding difficulties (BPFAS) predicted the impact on families (FS-IS daily activities score), over other variables of autism characteristics (SCQ total raw score) and sensory profiles (SSP-2 total raw score). All assumptions were tested including homoscedasticty of residuals and approximate normality of residuals. Sample size was calculated a priori using G*Power for multiple linear regression with \u03b1 = 0.05, power = 0.8 and three predictors (feeding difficulties, autism characteristics and sensory profiles). Tests were selected, conducted and reported according to conventions outlined in Laerd Statistics (Laerd Statistics, n.d.) using IBM SPSS Statistics.\n\n## 3 | RESULTS\n\n## 3.1 | Feeding characteristics of the children\n\nThe first aim of the study was to examine the nature of feeding difficulties in autistic children. The BPFAS total frequency score mean was\n\n95.5 (SD = 18.3, range = 8 -136), with 55 children who scored above 84, which was considered clinically significant (Ledford &amp; Gast, 2006). Where caregivers reported their feelings regarding their children's feeding difficulties, a mean score of 15.89 (SD = 9.97, range = 0 -31) using the BPFAS total problem score was observed. For the TPS, 57 children (68.75%) achieved a score above 9, which is indicative of clinically significant feeding difficulties (Ledford &amp; Gast, 2006). A list of the caregiver reported BPFAS highest and lowest frequency feeding behaviours can be found in the supporting information.\n\n## 3.2 | Feeding difficulties impact on families\n\nThe second aim of the study was to examine the relationship between children's feeding difficulties and the impact of these feeding difficulties on their families. Medians (range) for each FS-IS subscale for children with and without clinically significant feeding difficulties are listed in Table 3. At a group level, the impact of children's feeding difficulties on caregivers (FS-IS total score ) was found to be significantly higher for children who met the cut-off for clinically significant feeding difficulties than for children who did not (BPFAS TFS U = 257.000, z = /C0 4.471, p &lt; 0.001), with a moderate effect size (r = 0.50). The FS-IS subtests of worry (r = 0.50, p &lt; 0.001), feeding difficulties (r = 0.43, p &lt; 0.001) and total score (r = 0.50, p &lt; 0.001) were all observed to have a moderate to large effect size between the two groups (clinically and not clinically significant feeding difficulties). However, the daily activities' subtest was slightly lower (r = 0.34, p = 0.02) despite all the subtests showing statistical significance ( p &lt; 0.05).\n\nstatistically significant, moderate correlation between BPFAS-TFS and FS-IS Daily activities score, r s (98) = 0.56, p &lt; 0.01.\n\n## 3.3 | Predicting the impact of feeding difficulties on families\n\nThe third aim of the study was to determine whether children's level of feeding difficulties predicted the impact on their families, over and above autism characteristics and sensory profiles. Multiple linear regression compared the dependent variable (FS-IS total scores ) against the independent variables of feeding difficulties (BPFAS total frequency raw scores ), autism characteristics (SCQ-c urrent form raw scores ) and sensory profiles (SSP-2short form raw scores ) to determine the extent that each individual factor accounted for the impact on families. In the model, frequency of feeding difficulties (BPFAS-TFS) was the strongest predictor of impact on daily activities (FS-IS score) (F[1, 78] = 87.75, p &lt; 0.001, adj. R 2 = 0.52 (Laerd Statistics, n.d.)).\n\n## 4 | DISCUSSION\n\nChildren's frequency of feeding difficulties (BPFAS-TFS) and the impact of feeding difficulties on the family (FS-IS scores) were correlated. Specifically, analysis of each FS-IS subtest revealed a moderate positive correlation between BPFAS TFS and FS-IS daily activities score (r = 0.56, p = 0.02), worry (r = 0.68, p &lt; 0.001) and feeding difficulties (r = 0.62, p &lt; 0.001). However, the FS-IS total score (r = 0.73, p &lt; 0.001) indicated a high positive correlation with the BPFAS-TFS score. All correlations were statistically significant ( p &lt; 0.01). Preliminary analysis showed the correlation between the FS-IS daily activities score and BPFAS-TFS scores to be in a non-linear monotonic relationship (i.e., both variables increased but at different rates) as assessed by visual inspection of a scatterplot. There was a\n\nFeeding difficulties have a substantial impact on the health and wellbeing of autistic children and their caregivers. This study explored the complex interplay of autistic children's feeding difficulties, sensory profiles and autism characteristics on caregiver impact. Caregivers' results demonstrated that their children's frequency of feeding behaviours impacted both their daily lives and level of worry. This caregiver impact was higher for autistic children with clinically significant feeding difficulties compared to autistic children without clinically significant feeding difficulties. Furthermore, when feeding difficulties increased in autistic children, the impact on these feeding difficulties on caregivers increased as well. Autistic children's feeding difficulties were a unique predictor of caregiver impact over, and above other factors tested (Table 4).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 18959, "end_char_idx": 28070, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "------------------\nMetadata:\n{metadata_str}\n\nContent:\n\n{content}\n------------------", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f60d0f22-3419-4993-8101-6357b00e9cfa": {"__data__": {"id_": "f60d0f22-3419-4993-8101-6357b00e9cfa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Child - 2024 - Gent - Investigating the impact of autistic children s feeding difficulties on caregivers.pdf", "file_name": "Child - 2024 - Gent - Investigating the impact of autistic children s feeding difficulties on caregivers.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 673957, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a5803c19-c299-47ed-a6e4-76c1faac8b21", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Child - 2024 - Gent - Investigating the impact of autistic children s feeding difficulties on caregivers.pdf", "file_name": "Child - 2024 - Gent - Investigating the impact of autistic children s feeding difficulties on caregivers.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 673957, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "00637a3b7503e65a06f05d36e20f2caac564e1c3c2506bbf0b2dd3cf9c944047", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4f609c81-d9c1-4a80-8ad6-a4b9d4fa659f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Child - 2024 - Gent - Investigating the impact of autistic children s feeding difficulties on caregivers.pdf", "file_name": "Child - 2024 - Gent - Investigating the impact of autistic children s feeding difficulties on caregivers.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 673957, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "872dbe197586bab0d98b84e0d2a4e474f41bb0d6743198f57528807a57a6e963", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c203706f-4139-4bb6-9c8f-8d426dbbf7f7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4e2943158c237012fc4167e05768af12562b87ad39c7d211b22c6dd461dc6813", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Furthermore, when feeding difficulties increased in autistic children, the impact on these feeding difficulties on caregivers increased as well.

Caregivers reported mealtime behaviours such as food negotiation, extended mealtimes and additional meal offerings upon food refusal along with a predominantly carbohydrate-based diet, which have all been previously described in other studies exploring feeding difficulties in autistic children (Ausderau &amp; Juarez, 2013; Curtiss &amp; Ebata, 2019; Marshall et al., 2014; Sharp et al., 2013). The findings demonstrate that autistic children may experience substantial feeding difficulties that can impact not only their own health and wellbeing but also that of the caregiver-child mealtimes dynamics.\n\nWhen examining the relationship between feeding difficulties in autistic children and the impact on families, our findings were consistent with those of \u015e ahan et al. (2021) in that caregiver worry was higher for autistic children with clinically significant feeding difficulties compared with autistic children without clinically significant feeding difficulties. When the level of feeding difficulties increased, the impact of feeding difficulties on the family on their daily lives also increased. This aligns with current clinical understanding about the greater challenges for families when an autistic child presents with more than one feeding difficulty (such as chewing difficulties and nutritional concerns, swallowing difficulties and mealtime refusal) with resulting higher complexities around support and bigger impact of feeding difficulties on caregivers. These results extend research already published in the field exploring the importance of clinicians addressing caregiver concerns (Bonsall et al., 2021) because it is impacting not only their autistic children but also the families' lives. Validating caregiver level of worry and understanding impact is crucial to enable a broader focus that is not just assessing feeding skills in autistic children. These quantitative findings build on qualitative work (Rogers et al., 2012) highlighting the impact of feeding difficulties on families and emphasis the need to work more collaboratively with autistic children and their caregivers in relation to feeding difficulties and mealtimes.\n\nThe third aim of the study was to determine the extent to which each factor (feeding difficulties, autism characteristics and sensory profiles) accounted for the impact of feeding difficulties on caregivers. Consistent with this study's hypothesis, frequency of feeding difficulties in our cohort was a unique predictor of caregiver impact, over other predictors such as autism characteristics and sensory profiles. This was a surprising result, given the expansive body of literature describing the relationship between sensory processing and parental stress (Enea &amp; Rusu, 2020; Page et al., 2022). These results are, however, consistent with the work done by Thullen and Bonsall (2017) who explored the impact of parenting stress with feeding challenges in 113 caregivers of autistic children aged 5 -14 years. They found that while food selectivity was high, it was the mealtime behaviours that added the highest level of stress around mealtimes. Our study adds further information around mealtime behaviours as a unique predictor of caregiver stress but suggests that further research is warranted.\n\nOur findings are also consistent with the broader literature (Page et al., 2022) that indicates that the level of autism characteristics (measured on the SCQ and commonly referred to as severity) is not associated with autistic children's feeding difficulties. Therefore, practitioners, and those who provide funding for supports, should avoid making assumptions regarding the likely needs of children and their families based on the children's autism characteristics. Our study adds further weight to the need for health professionals working in paediatric feeding to consider the factors behind mealtime stressors. This includes exploring the impact of co-occurring diagnoses of ADHD and anxiety (both highly represented in this sample) as well as exploring these influences on mealtime refusals with clinical psychologists and children's sensory needs with occupational therapists. The variability of different factors highlights the need for individualised assessment and therapy across all aspects of daily life cares for autistic children and their caregivers.\n\n## 4.1 | Limitations\n\nThe findings of this study must be considered with respect to several limitations. First, while the use of an online survey was effective in reaching the target sample of 80 autistic children across geographical areas, it was not feasible with study constraints to contact caregivers for documentation to clarify autism levels or confirm diagnoses. Asking caregivers to provide diagnostic reports could be considered in future studies, however, was considered too burdensome on caregivers in this current study. Some of the demographic information about participants' race/ethnicity was also missing due to a survey error. A sample size of 80 was calculated apriori using G*Power for multiple linear regression with \u03b1 = 0.05, power = 0.8 and three\n\npredictors (feeding difficulties, autism characteristics and sensory profiles); however, exploring a bigger sample size would be useful to understand different cultural and demographical influences. Additionally, the geographical region was heavily weighted to the state where the first author resided in and not evenly distributed across all states of the country.\n\nAnother limitation was that data collection relied on caregiver report rather than direct assessment, which may have biassed the results; however, direct assessment was not possible in an online survey. While the study was open to all caregivers of autistic children regardless of whether their child had feeding difficulties, it is acknowledged that caregivers were more likely to participate in this study if they were worried about their children's feeding. Therefore, frequency of feeding difficulties may be over-represented and not a true representation of the whole autistic community.\n\nA strength of this study was the inclusion of reliable and valid caregiver-reported tools. We acknowledge that there was some conceptual overlap between the BPFAS and FS-IS tools, but the correlation between the TFS and FS-IS Daily Activity scores was found to be moderate, which would not have violated assumptions in our final regression model. While the Short Sensory Profile-2 (SSP-2) was used to explore the relationship of sensory profiles, the decision around selecting a screener as opposed to the Sensory Profile-2 was based on the need to reduce caregiver burden in what was a comprehensive one-hour survey.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 27793, "end_char_idx": 37378, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "------------------\nMetadata:\n{metadata_str}\n\nContent:\n\n{content}\n------------------", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c203706f-4139-4bb6-9c8f-8d426dbbf7f7": {"__data__": {"id_": "c203706f-4139-4bb6-9c8f-8d426dbbf7f7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Child - 2024 - Gent - Investigating the impact of autistic children s feeding difficulties on caregivers.pdf", "file_name": "Child - 2024 - Gent - Investigating the impact of autistic children s feeding difficulties on caregivers.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 673957, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a5803c19-c299-47ed-a6e4-76c1faac8b21", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Child - 2024 - Gent - Investigating the impact of autistic children s feeding difficulties on caregivers.pdf", "file_name": "Child - 2024 - Gent - Investigating the impact of autistic children s feeding difficulties on caregivers.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 673957, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "00637a3b7503e65a06f05d36e20f2caac564e1c3c2506bbf0b2dd3cf9c944047", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f60d0f22-3419-4993-8101-6357b00e9cfa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Child - 2024 - Gent - Investigating the impact of autistic children s feeding difficulties on caregivers.pdf", "file_name": "Child - 2024 - Gent - Investigating the impact of autistic children s feeding difficulties on caregivers.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 673957, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "a944c4f5cb43599c9ce9cee66a11451e4ec2a9f27fee4589c825899a633b1845", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e987d84a-6af3-45b4-afb8-0ef55c629c22", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f9e9216f8df2d097d7e4915532686a3760c52357b0d80d9d44c879f1d4f1026a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "## 4.2 | Implications and future directions\n\nOur study highlights the impact of autistic children's feeding difficulties on their families. This is the first study to identify the unique contribution that autistic children's feeding difficulties make on caregiver impact over and above autism characteristics and sensory profiles. While the findings can immediately inform clinical practice by encouraging clinicians to begin the conversation with caregivers about how their children's feeding difficulties are impacting the family, future research can guide the development of new and desirable supports. First, study replication exploring the inter-play of the relationship between sensory profiles and feeding skills will deepen the research knowledge around autistic children's feeding and caregiver impact. However, in considering future research directions, consideration must be given not just to what is examined and explored but how the research is conducted. Working collaboratively with autistic caregivers as well as non-autistic caregivers will help health professionals explore how best to support caregivers and their autistic children.\n\nImportantly, caregivers typically reported on their children's feeding difficulties, and while this acknowledges their real-life experiences, recent evidence from the autistic community encourages us to consider that these differences exist because of the challenges of living in a world that favours neurotypical/non-autistic feeding patterns. It is hoped that future research can work closely with the autistic community in bridging the gap around these differences to create more inclusive support.\n\n## 5 | CONCLUSION\n\nThis study demonstrated that caregiver worry was higher for autistic children with clinically significant difficulties across the primary school aged group. More so, as the feeding difficulties increased in children, the impact of these difficulties on caregivers increased as well. Autistic children's feeding difficulties were a unique predictor of caregiver impact over and above autism characteristics and sensory profiles. These findings help inform health professionals of the importance of exploring the caregiver impact of their children's feeding difficulties rather than only assessing feeding impairment in autistic children and supporting caregivers in seeking additional support as needed. At a broader policy level, considerations need to be made around supporting caregiver level of worry with autistic children who present with feeding difficulties. Future research using a strength-based co-designed approach with the autistic community will ensure research findings are in line with best practice with supporting autistic children and their families.\n\n## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe would like to take this opportunity to thank the families who participated in this study as well as Griffith University for the funding to ensure these important caregiver experiences can be shared.

Autistic individuals typically have a high level of sensitivity to the various environmental stimuli (smell, noise, light). These stimuli have a positive or negative influence on the person -environment interaction, and an excess of stimuli may create inappropriate or unanticipated behavioral responses (such as a crisis) effecting their well-being. The Model of Competence, which provides an explanation of the interaction between the individual and the environment, was selected as the conceptual framework to direct this study. The purpose of this study is to investigate the opinions and experiences of mothers regarding the influence of the characteristics of the home environment on autistic individuals. A qualitative interpretative description design was utilized for this study ' s framework. Participants in the study were mothers who have autistic children. The study with focus groups was continued until data saturation was reached. There was a thematic investigation carried out. The findings show that the factors that have an effect on autistic individuals can be categorized into several subsets like sensory, routines, and physical environment. Despite the fact that the home setting is often a secure and consistent environment, these aspects were identified as crucial. Consequently, one should give some thought to the consequences that this could have in other settings where it would be harder to exercise control. The identification of these factors and the impact they have enables a better understanding of the interaction between an autistic individual and their environment and serves to guide professionals in their interventions.\n\n## KEYWORDS\n\nautism, neurodevelopment problems, physical environment, sensory issues\n\n## 1 | INTRODUCTION\n\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that begins early in life and is used to\n\nAbbreviations: ASD, autism spectrum disorders; R1, first reduction stage; M7, Mothers seventh.\n\ndescribe individuals with a specific combination of impaired social communication and repetitive behavior, highly restricted interests, and/or sensory behaviors with clinical heterogeneity based on genetics and brain development and connectivity (Karag\u00f6z &amp; G\u00fcndo /C21 gdu, 2022; Y \u0131 lmaz, 2023). The prevalence of ASD, which is one of\n\nthe most common neurodevelopmental disorders in childhood and is estimated to affect approximately 1% of the population worldwide, is increasing day by day. In ASD, the coexistence of two or more disorders is usually noticed in the same individual.\n\nAutistic individuals have pharmacological supports that can improve social communication, reduce anxiety and aggression, and medications that can minimize comorbid symptoms. Because there is no single treatment for ASD, medical support that relieves symptoms and evidence-based treatments that begin early in development benefit autistic children. In addition, in order to carry out the treatments in the center such as that school and clinic in the home environment and to increase the adaptation behaviors of these children, not only the school and clinical environments but also the home environments should be structured. Environmental hazards for autistic children are limited, and family and residential environments should be regulated under preventive protective systems (Pfeiffer et al., 2017). In the literature, home accidents may be at the beginning of the risky situations. Safety skills to prevent domestic accidents are often addressed by classifying them according to parts of the home, such as the kitchen, bathroom, and general living quarters (Collins et al., 1991).\n\nOther conditions that involve risk and indirectly affect the physical and mental health of the autistic child are related to well-being. The quality of life of autistic individuals is lower than that of the general population, and environmental systems, such as the individual ' s home environment, are thought to affect well-being (McConachie et al., 2018). It has been noted that autistic children may be more sensitive to sensory stimuli in the environment, such as texture, color, type of light, or shape of objects, including noise or excessive visual stimuli (Mostafa, 2014; Pfeiffer et al., 2017; S /C19 anchez et al., 2011). Since certain elements (e.g., noise) can trigger tantrums or cause inappropriate behavior, there is a potential for self-harm on the individual. Another condition that can jeopardize the health of the child is unresponsiveness to pain. Insensitivity to pain can be experienced during an accident or attempted self-harm and is counted among the common behaviors in this population (Richards et al., 2012). It is therefore particularly important to structure the environment in a way that ensures environmental safety (Brown &amp; Dunn, 2010; Kirby et al., 2017).\n\n## 1.1 | Sensory data processing\n\nThe term ' Sensory Processing-Sensory Integration Deficiencies ' may be used to refer to one of the challenges\n\nthat may be encountered in connection with ASD. According to Tomchek and Dunn (2007), sensory processing disorder is a complicated brain disorder that appears to impact the way in which children receive ordinary sensory information. This includes processing of the auditory, visual, and tactile senses. The presumption underlying the majority of hypotheses regarding autism spectrum disorder is that people with the disorder process sensory information in a manner distinct from that of typically developing people. Early hypotheses about the origins of atypical behavior in autistic individuals were based on observations of either overstimulation or underarousal to sensory stimuli. These data formed the basis for these theories. According to the majority of the currently accepted hypotheses about ASD, problems in sensory processing are one of the most prominent symptoms of autism. These abnormalities also have repercussions for the development of the perceptual system in autistic children. Children are far more likely to become upset and overreact when they are presented with stimuli such as bright lights, loud noises, strong odors, and different textures. According to Dawson and Watling (2000), children diagnosed with ASD have issues with their sensory processing in a percentage ranging from 30% to 100%. According to Quill (2000), autistic children frequently struggle to manage sensory stimuli such as information that is visual, aural, or tactile. Therefore, it may be concluded that the regulatory behaviors they use are for the purpose of managing the information that is received from the senses. These regulatory behaviors may include clapping their hands, covering their ears to block out hearing, bouncing up and down, panicking, withdrawing when touched, avoiding specific textures and odors, and/or waving their fingers in front of their eyes (Pi et al., 2023). On the basis of these complicated sensory processing issues, there emerges a series of explainable cause-effect correlations about how toddlers manage with their environment and how they stumble upon challenging behaviors (Iarocci &amp; McDonald, 2006). The conclusion that can be drawn from this is that children ' s difficulties in processing their senses are the root cause of their behavioral issues.\n\n## 1.1.1 | Routines and organizations\n\nSome of the difficulties experienced may be due to the needs of autistic children for routines and configurations. Most autistic children prefer routines because routines seem to serve to avoid anxiety by providing structure and predictability. The calmness that is free from anxiety and the regularity of the physical environment seem to increase the child ' s ability to function. Routines can\n\nsupport autistic children by improving understanding of a daily event and/or activity and can help the child manage stress and anxiety. It is stated that the child ' s need for routines may increase during times of stress or illness during daily events involving change (Attwood, 2006).\n\n## 1.1.2 | Visual schedules\n\nOne type of staging intervention that can be used as transition support is a visual activity chart. Visual activity charts are useful because while harnessing the power of visual processing, they provide support for some common deficits that autistic children experience such as auditory processing, language use, and memory (Ganz et al., 2014). This tool contains pictures, drawings, objects, or images arranged in order to show autistic children the order of their day (Banda et al., 2009). An activity chart can be used to help autistic children transition between activities (Bryan &amp; Gast, 2000); they function by showing them the current activity, the next activity, and giving a concrete signal for the completion of an activity.\n\n## 1.1.3 | Anxiety at home\n\nMost families recognize the safety of their autistic children as a major concern and often have to make environmental changes to ensure their children ' s safety. Typical safety precautions and changes are made in the first few years of childhood. These adaptations can take place in many different possibilities such as doors, door locks, camera monitoring of the environment, child-proof cabinets, and turning off electrical outlets.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 9998, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "------------------\nMetadata:\n{metadata_str}\n\nContent:\n\n{content}\n------------------", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7fbec4ff-6672-45fc-89d2-8a52ffe010ba": {"__data__": {"id_": "7fbec4ff-6672-45fc-89d2-8a52ffe010ba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Intl J of Devlp Neuroscience - 2023 - Kahveci - The effect of the home environment on children with autism spectrum.pdf", "file_name": "Intl J of Devlp Neuroscience - 2023 - Kahveci - The effect of the home environment on children with autism spectrum.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 200080, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5067dac1-2bf7-43ce-af2a-77506c97af2e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Intl J of Devlp Neuroscience - 2023 - Kahveci - The effect of the home environment on children with autism spectrum.pdf", "file_name": "Intl J of Devlp Neuroscience - 2023 - Kahveci - The effect of the home environment on children with autism spectrum.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 200080, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "c612d33b8d1d281e0dee001847a81e1e80f12c476d03632ccec53d0019a0753d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f89366ba-1467-4634-b3e2-3feb97479d4f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Intl J of Devlp Neuroscience - 2023 - Kahveci - The effect of the home environment on children with autism spectrum.pdf", "file_name": "Intl J of Devlp Neuroscience - 2023 - Kahveci - The effect of the home environment on children with autism spectrum.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 200080, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "3e8992aa7bb19233c992a96b609b14c57b76bed5ff8034988a2786d3423f48cb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "05bf5025-69ca-4fa3-95a6-a98003b4daaf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4617caa421f36f91df389882794d253a75264d01591b104abf960e1d2a87948c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Typical safety precautions and changes are made in the first few years of childhood. These adaptations can take place in many different possibilities such as doors, door locks, camera monitoring of the environment, child-proof cabinets, and turning off electrical outlets. For autistic children, these reassurances last longer than expected and require all family members to adjust and monitor their behavior (Nevison et al., 2018). In addition, the autistic child may exhibit inappropriate behaviors such as climbing and/or jumping from furniture to meet an unmet sensory need. In this case, families may prefer to use more solid, rounded, or fixed furniture with sharp edges.\n\n## 1.1.4 | Generalization at home of what is learned at school\n\nIt is helpful to remember that families may need guidance on how best to structure their routines and home surroundings to adapt to the demands of their children and encourage learning opportunities. This is something that should be considered in order to provide assistance. The next discussion will focus on particular aspects of the physical environment, such as the landscaping,\n\nthe aesthetics, the accessibility, and utilization of visual aids, as well as the effect of safety and security on the environment.\n\n## 1.1.5 | Home environment\n\nThere is no specific research that has been identified on how the environment of the household affects autistic children. On the other hand, there has been some research done on the topic of how the physical environment of the classroom plays an essential part in the lives of preschool children who have special needs (Boyd et al., 2008). The physical arrangement and classroom layout (such as organization), aesthetics (such as colors and textures, lighting), usage of visual aids in the environment, and measures to promote safety and security in the environment are all considered as parts of the classroom.\n\nAccording to Mostafa (2014), the majority of the study on the person -environment interaction in relation to ASD has been conducted on children who participate in activities and studies while they are at school. However, there has not been a lot of research done on the family surroundings of autistic children. The home is the location where a person spends the most of their time and often includes other people, such as their parents and siblings, in addition to the non-human surroundings and its characteristics. Since the symptoms of autistic individuals continue throughout life (Murphy et al., 2016), environmental characteristics that may affect adults living with ASD need to be determined in order to provide more accurate interventions from both health professionals and professionals who receive special education. It is thought that the information provided by the individual ' s environment can be very useful in determining these characteristics. It can be said that the views of the parents are related to the experiences since they share the same house with their autistic children. Since the environment is influential on one ' s activities and roles, this study is based on the Competence Model (Rousseau, 2017; Rousseau et al., 2002). This model explains the interaction between person and environment through six concepts: person, environment (human and non-human), activities, roles, competence status, and handicap status.\n\nActivities and roles represent interaction; thus, the person is positioned in a state of continuity or inadequacy according to success or failure in activities and roles. The environment can provide positive or negative stimuli to the person (Rousseau et al., 2002). In this study, the nonhuman environment is represented by the physical elements of the house and by mothers living with autistic children. Activities and roles, respectively, were\n\nrepresented by the interaction between the person and his non-human home environment. The aim of this study is to reveal the experiences and views of the mother about the characteristics of the home environment that affect the behavior of her autistic child.\n\n## 2 | MATERIAL AND METOD\n\nThe study was conducted in a qualitative interpretative descriptive research format using the focus group technique (Krueger &amp; Casey, 2015; Thorne, 2016). The research questions were as follows: (1) What are the elements of the non-human home environment that influence your child ' s behavior? (2) How do these factors affect your child ' s activities at home? To seek answers to these questions, (1) brief information about the participants, (2) information about the data collection process, and (3) analysis of the data were presented.\n\n## 2.1 | Participants\n\nThe research ethics committee at Girne American University (24th October 2022/5/22-130) approved this study and all participants gave written informed consent before enrolment. The criteria used in the selection of the participants are as follows: (1) being the family of a child diagnosed with ASD and attending primary school, (2) having a family with Turkish communication and living in Ankara, (3) having married or divorced parents living in separate houses in the family. Thus, the criteria of homogeneity (having an autistic child) and heterogeneity (different families) were met in the study (Morgan, 1996).\n\nfrom all central districts of Ankara who have been diagnosed with ASD and attend a special education center (Table 1).\n\n## 2.2 | Data collecting\n\n' Focus groups ' were chosen as the preferred data collection technique (Wilson, 1997). After obtaining verbal consent from the mothers to participate in the study, the consent form was signed during the group meeting when they came to the special education school and the answers to the related questions were recorded by the teachers. Mothers of autistic children who voluntarily participated in the study were included in focus groups (n = 67). The meetings were held at the special education center at different intervals. In order to ensure the participation of the mothers, the hours they came to the school were selected and an adaptation was made to include at least two and at most six mothers. There is a moderator and teachers who are assistant moderators in each session. The moderator is a research specialist and a graduate student with focus group lead experience. The assistant moderator, also a graduate student, took notes throughout the meetings to complete the information obtained from the recording. A summary study was conducted at the end of each meeting to verify the elements stated by the participants, and the answers given were reviewed. The nature of the subject supports the detailed sharing of the participants, so that it is possible to obtain more reliable data as smaller groups allow the participants to express themselves better. The length of group sessions was set to be 2 /C2 45 min, and all sessions were recorded (audio).\n\nThe concept of universe can mean a continent, a country, a city, and an institution, as well as masses that contain certain demographic characteristics such as a profession, gender, race, age, and marital status. The universe of this research is a private special education school in Ankara. The participants are the mothers of students\n\nThe interview guide used by the moderator consisted of open-ended questions. In the sessions, mothers were asked to share their additional observations. It consists of the conceptual framework of the study and the subsection units guided by Krueger and Casey (2015): Sessions were held as opening, introduction, transition, key and final questions (Table 2).

The last question asked in the research: (2) If you could build the ideal home for your child and family from the start, what would it be like? Please explain.\n\n## 2.3 | Data analysis\n\nA thematic content analysis was conducted (Neuendorf, 2018). First, the audio recording was transcribed verbatim (Rousseau et al., 2002). The coding was validated on text excerpts made separately by the two authors, with a 78% agreement. The percentage of verification can be explained by the overlap of some codes.\n\nThe transcripts made with voice recording were coded using the Nvivo software program (QSR International, 2018). Then, the first and second authors in the study performed data reduction in one step (R1) depending on the codes. In this reduction, consistency between the two researchers was ensured\n\nand the themes and sub-themes were determined (Neuendorf, 2018). For example, in the first reduction stage (R1), the data were not migrated to the new code, as consistency was determined after creating a table with the first code of some quotations from the word-by-word.\n\n## 2.4 | Limitations\n\nThis research was conducted in Turkey and Ankara districts and represents a small part of the Turkish sample. In addition, considering the heterogeneity of ASD profiles, it is known that the needs of children will differ according to the severity of the disorder and the types of symptoms (Charman, 2014; Fountain et al., 2012; Nazeer &amp; Ghaziuddin, 2012). For this reason, it is necessary to conduct the research with high number of participants.\n\n## 3 | DISCUSSION AND RESULTS\n\nThe aim of this study is to reveal the experiences and views of the mother about the characteristics of the home environment that affect the behavior of her autistic child. Examples of key questions used in the study are as follows: (1) Think about your child ' s behavior at home. Can you list at least three elements of the non-human environment that have the most impact on your child ' s behavior, both positive and negative? The last question asked in the research: (2) If you could build the ideal home for your child and family from the start, what would it be like?\n\nThe first question asked in the research was examined and the factors that will have the most positive effect on the behavior of the mothers ' children are to prevent clutter in the house (100%), to ensure that the materials taken into the house are strong, not to harm the child when broken, and when the sensory room is built and used for sensory integration studies, their children will be more sensitive to environmental stimuli. They also stated that they believed that autistic children would give appropriate feedback (72%). Mothers reported that leaving a special area in the house for assistive technology devices, choosing special wall colors in the house, and allocating a special room for tantrums were the conditions that had a minimum impact on their children (0%).\n\nAsked in the survey (2) ' If you could build the ideal home for your child and family from the start, what would it be like? ' The answers given by the mothers to the last question were divided into sections and the following results were obtained.\n\nMothers stated that a relaxation area should be created for the child by providing a quiet place for their autistic children to be organized and enjoy sameness. (Mothers seventh) M7 ' It would be great if there were a few secluded or secluded corners in the house where no one would disturb you and where you can enjoy peace and quiet. ' M28 ' He could play music by himself, listen to music, even practice reading aloud to himself. ' Mothers suggested that the child use headphones instead of adjusting the acoustics of the rooms. M25, M46, M57 ' Can use headphones to prevent sound. ' They argued that a sensory room may be needed for children to respond appropriately to sensory stimuli, but stimuli such as paint color, light, and noise should be used carefully in the house.\n\nIn addition, mothers ensured clear, simple, and predictable building layout and spaces/corners, using visual cues to line up activities and items and hanging them regularly in appropriate places in the home, using visual cues to identify what is behind doors (toilet, bedroom, etc.).\n\nIn order for children with autism to have a high quality of life and improve their well-being and to help the child calm down after a tantrum or excessive stress, it is necessary to provide the necessary personal space to respect individual privacy and welfare rights and to create a ' quiet room ' consisting of items that will not cause harm. They explained to their suggestions that a suitable space should be provided at home for them to interact with peers, parents, and society. M53 ' No one wants us to their house. If he has his own room, they can play in his private room with their peers and relatives. ' Mothers emphasized that both small and large areas should be provided to perform games and gross motor activities in their house plans, and they also stated that corridors should be wide. They also stated that safe physical boundaries should be established in order to provide freedom of movement in closed areas, and lock and camera systems could be installed. They explained that the household items should be strong enough to withstand behaviors involving anger, but they stated that the items should be fixed so that they do not cause damage in the event of an earthquake. They explained that there will be a need for abundant storage areas in the house, so that the environment will be more organized and clutter will be easy to collect.\n\n## 4 | CONCLUSION\n\nCreating a safe and secure environment is a primary concern for the well-being of autistic children, as with all children. Many professionals (Burton-Hoyle, 2011;\n\nCase-Smith &amp; Arbesman, 2008; Inan, 2009) have observed that simple environmental changes can play an important role in the lives of children with special needs, especially. Simple changes such as a quiet corner or rocking chairs and armchairs are beneficial for overwhelmed children to encourage sensory regulation and reduce inappropriate behavior (Case-Smith &amp; Arbesman, 2008; Inan, 2009). Allen and Schwartz (1996) explained that it is important that the physical environment be free of any obstacles (e.g., clutter, slippery floors, and crumpled rugs) so that serious injuries do not occur. While Quill (2000) states that a distracting environment has the potential to react negatively to the environment, Moore (1996) acknowledges that safety may be hindered if the space is too small and there are too many people in it, and recommends spacious living spaces for autistic children. Additionally, children may be adversely affected by noise and confusion, which may require more supervision. The reviewed research findings support the idea that physical environments may be important considerations for autistic children. Davis and Fox (1999), in 43 studies dealing with environment regulation and/or modification, reveal the importance of the physical environment and show parallelism with the findings of this study. The results of this study can guide professionals in their intervention in this population. However, more research is needed to better understand human-environment interaction in the living environment and to provide tools for professionals.\n\n## 5 | RECOMMEDATIONS\n\n- If you have recently learned that your child has or may have autism spectrum disorder, you are probably wondering what will happen next. No parent is ready to hear that their child is not happy and healthy, and a diagnosis of ASD can be especially frightening.\n- There are many treatments that can help children with ASD learn new skills and overcome a wide range of developmental challenges. From free government services to at-home behavior therapy and school-based programs, there is help available to meet your child ' s specific needs and help them learn, grow, and succeed in life.\n- Figure out what triggers your kid ' s challenging or disruptive behaviors and what elicits a positive response. What does your child find stressful or frightening? If you understand what affects your child, you will be better at troubleshooting problems and preventing or modifying situations that cause difficulties.\n- Accept your child, his quirks, and all. Recognize how different your child with autism is from other children and celebrate your child ' s small successes. Make him\n\nfeel unconditionally loved and accepted. It will help your child more than anything.\n\n- Do not give up. People with autism also have a whole life to grow and develop their abilities.\n\n## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nNone.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 19002, "end_char_idx": 28444, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "------------------\nMetadata:\n{metadata_str}\n\nContent:\n\n{content}\n------------------", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "989e349e-0ba5-4b2b-9e19-3ed2a811f72f": {"__data__": {"id_": "989e349e-0ba5-4b2b-9e19-3ed2a811f72f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Intl J of Devlp Neuroscience - 2023 - Kahveci - The effect of the home environment on children with autism spectrum.pdf", "file_name": "Intl J of Devlp Neuroscience - 2023 - Kahveci - The effect of the home environment on children with autism spectrum.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 200080, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5067dac1-2bf7-43ce-af2a-77506c97af2e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Intl J of Devlp Neuroscience - 2023 - Kahveci - The effect of the home environment on children with autism spectrum.pdf", "file_name": "Intl J of Devlp Neuroscience - 2023 - Kahveci - The effect of the home environment on children with autism spectrum.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 200080, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "c612d33b8d1d281e0dee001847a81e1e80f12c476d03632ccec53d0019a0753d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "05bf5025-69ca-4fa3-95a6-a98003b4daaf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\Intl J of Devlp Neuroscience - 2023 - Kahveci - The effect of the home environment on children with autism spectrum.pdf", "file_name": "Intl J of Devlp Neuroscience - 2023 - Kahveci - The effect of the home environment on children with autism spectrum.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 200080, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "1af1a4fca043a15920227c3c3d71fe60ee037040e6217f6b3e1a579b45627e06", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1a73a41b-bb5a-414a-aeae-739daa2be023", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "527ab7a45981c92bd7877a539c9a3ad9fd8f5803daafecc6e56f243d69dda881", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Make him\n\nfeel unconditionally loved and accepted.

The survey consisted of questions relating to the benefits and risks of fidget toys as well as statements about their own child's fidget toy use. The Sensory Profile 2 was used to obtain parents perspectives on their child's sensory behaviours. The main findings demonstrated that parents of autistic children perceived fidget toys and fidget spinners to be overall more beneficial than NT parents, especially in relation to reducing anxiety. Higher sensory-seeking scores for both autistic children and NT children were associated with greater parental agreement for fidget  toys  and  fidget  spinners  being  beneficial.  Parents  of  autistic  children  with  higher  sensory  seeking scores found fidget toys to reduce anxiety and spinners to be less distracting. Whereas, parents of NT children with higher sensory seeking scores perceived both fidget toys and spinners to help their child concentrate. Implications include that educators should consider parental views when forming policies about the use of fidget toys. Findings also imply that the sensory profiles of autistic and NT students should be considered in relation to the use of fidget toys.\n\nKeywords Autism \u00b7 Sensory processing \u00b7 Sensory-seeking \u00b7 Fidget toys\n\n## Sensory processing\n\nSensory  processing  involves  recognising  and  regulating sensory  information  as  well  as  responding  appropriately (Gourley et  al.,  2013).  Sensory  processing  difficulties  are associated  with  neurodevelopmental  conditions  such  as autism (Critz et al., 2015). Moreover, fidgeting can occur in children who have sensory processing difficulties, and it can also be the result of physical responses to internal feel -ings such as nervousness, boredom or anxiety (Cohen et al., 2018). It is important to identify appropriate means to assist their  needs  to  encourage  equal  opportunities  in  terms  of learning and social experiences. One such example of this is through the use of fidget toys. However, there is incon -clusive evidence for the benefits of fidget toys, especially for children with sensory processing difficulties. This study sought  to  investigate  parental  perspectives  about  whether fidget toys were beneficial for autistic children and/ or neu -rotypical (NT) children and their sensory profiles were also examined using the Sensory Profile Questionnaire (SPQ 2, Dunn, 2014).\n\nElisa Back e.back@kingston.ac.uk\n\n1 Department of Psychology, Faculty of Business and Social Sciences, Kingston University London, Penrhyn Road, Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, London KT1 2EE, UK\n\n2 Psychology and Human Development, IOE UCL's Faculty of Education and Society, London, UK\n\nThe SPQ 2 (Dunn, 2014) was established for caregivers to  report  their  child's  responses  to  various  sensory  stimuli and for professionals to measure factors that affect children's sensory  processing  in  their  daily  lives.  The  SPQ  assesses four categories; low registration (passive response to sensory stimuli),  sensory  sensitivity  (discomfort  to  sensation),  sen -sation  seeking  (seeks/creates  sensation  in  the  environment) and sensation avoiding (limits exposure to sensory stimuli) (Dunn, 1997). The SPQ has been used to identify any differ -ences in the sensory needs of autistic and NT children. Tom -chek and Dunn (2007) conducted a comparative study using the  Short  Sensory  Profile  and  found  significant  differences\n\nwith  regards  to  the  category  under  responsive/seeks  sensa -tion with the autistic group seeking sensation for a variety of sources including auditory, vestibular, tactile and propriocep -tion in order to satisfy their needs. Sensory seeking behav -iours  can  manifest  as  excessive  movements,  fidgeting  or even licking an object with the intention of gaining enhanced stimulation (Ben-Sasson et al., 2009). In order to overcome the challenges that sensory processing difficulties may pres -ent, fidget toys are often used as a sensory based intervention within the classroom (van der Wurff et al., 2021).\n\nThe role of fidgeting within the classroom environment has been negatively perceived as a form of inattention (Lis et al., 2010). Carson et al. (2001) suggest that educators view atten -tive students as those who are sitting still. Pine et al. ( 2007) discovered that when 65 NT children aged six to eight were prohibited from making hand gestures on a lexical retrieval task, they struggled to provide as many correct answers com -pared to when they were allowed to use gestural movements. The consequences of suppressing fidgeting movements could in fact hinder children's ability to thrive in a classroom envi -ronment (Lengel &amp; Kuczala, 2010). Therefore, professionals such as occupational therapists and educational psychologists have introduced fidget toys to serve as coping mechanisms for assisting sensory needs (Benson et al., 2019).\n\n## Fidget toys and fidget spinners\n\n## Anxiety\n\nAutistic people often present sensory seeking behaviours, in particular tactile ones in an attempt to self-regulate anxiety (Miller et al., 2007). Anxiety is a common concern in the autistic population (White et al., 2009). Fidget toys can serve as a means to self-regulate, allowing children to discreetly reach their optimal level of arousal necessary for attention and on-task behaviour (van der Wurff et al., 2021). Market -ers of the fidget spinner have purported benefits of reduced stress for children with particular needs, despite a lack of scientific evidence to show beneficial use of a fidget spinner (Schecter et al., 2017). Given the prevalence rates of sen -sory processing difficulties and anxiety in autistic children, there  are  very  limited  studies  assessing  the  effectiveness of fidget toys in this population. A study by Ledford et al. (2020) involved four autistic children (aged 3-6) who were allowed to choose a fidget toy during a group activity, and it was shown that children's engagement did not improve and that  their  focus  was  on  manipulating  the  fidget  toy  rather than attending to the teacher. Similar results were found by Cihon et al. (2020) who evaluated auditory attention while using a fidget spinner device in two autistic participants and they found no positive effect on their overall levels of con -centration. The benefits of fidget toys outside of the class -room has been evidenced in a study by Fletcher-Watson and\n\nMay (2018) who found that fidget toys helped reduce anxi -ety levels for autistic people during an arts festival. As this accommodated their sensory needs and enabled individuals to self-regulate their social interaction.\n\n## Concentration and distraction\n\nOther studies have assessed the use of fidget toys in NT pop -ulations. Stalvey and Brassell (2006) introduced the use of stress balls for 29 sixth-grade students during independent and teacher-led tasks and found an increase in concentration and a reduction in the frequency of distractions and inatten -tion. In Da C\u00e2mara et al.'s (2018) study involving interviews, observations, and workshops with 28 children aged six to 11, 24 parents and two teachers, it was identified that fidgeting was the result of a variety of reasons; engaging in cognitive tasks  such  as  reading,  thinking,  and  learning,  as  a  way  to expend energy, and to regulate emotion. Boredom was found to be the most common reason for a child to fidget. Children chose  fidget  toys  to  satisfy  particular  desires  or  emotions; children would squeeze a toy when angry but would press, click or tap when performing a cognitive task.\n\nThe impact of fidget toys on concentration levels is widely debated by practitioners (Schecter et al., 2017), as there has been conflicting evidence whether fidget toys, and spinners in particular have any benefits with others arguing they have the potential to distract students. Tombu and Jolicoeur (2004) suggest that using a fidget toy is a secondary task which could detract attention from the primary task. This was evident in studies with university students; Gligoric et al.'s (2012) study identified  'fidgeting'  as  one  of  the  most  common  factors which results in a lack of focus in lectures.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 8891, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "------------------\nMetadata:\n{metadata_str}\n\nContent:\n\n{content}\n------------------", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cedd69cf-c1c0-46a9-bd38-9b34837905db": {"__data__": {"id_": "cedd69cf-c1c0-46a9-bd38-9b34837905db", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\s12144-023-05483-3.pdf", "file_name": "s12144-023-05483-3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1026220, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dd110ed1-a02d-4bc5-af97-dc62801740e2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\s12144-023-05483-3.pdf", "file_name": "s12144-023-05483-3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1026220, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "1a46fa8049d4dc9cb62dd88a30fa6db268b25c09daedb2141363c4746e0efc51", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "57e2c3b9-2e37-4bd7-96fa-4d4543bb2a6f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\s12144-023-05483-3.pdf", "file_name": "s12144-023-05483-3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1026220, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "58d14f9b2d87bef695d57321debde3f704ba7978cb1edff1ebfa29425fa1e398", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c3bfd594-23d6-4ee9-9c43-e6ff601299a3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "82189ec46d6ca70b5d99ebdec041be90338930e20f6f22b2d7e12cf18f7227ac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "'s (2012) study identified  'fidgeting'  as  one  of  the  most  common  factors which results in a lack of focus in lectures. Whereas the results of  Farley  et  al.  (2013)  highlighted  that  fidgeting  increased retention of lecture material, suggesting that it was used to optimise attention. This is reinforced by Slater's (2012) study which revealed that fidget toys provided a positive impact on behaviour and refocused students' attention.\n\nIn terms of fidget spinners, Hulac et al.'s. (2020) study with 54 third-grade NT students indicated impaired academic per -formance on maths tasks when the fidget spinner was used in comparison to when it was not. Soares and Storm's (2019) study also observed a negative effect of fidget spinners on memory in college students. The researchers suggested the decline  in  academic  performance  could  be  due  to  the  fea -tures of the fidget spinner (bright colours and noise) which could be distracting not only for those students using them but also other students in the classroom. Fidget spinners have been  argued  to  be  more  demanding  than  other  fidget  toys - they require cognitive, visual and motor resources. How -ever,  there  has  been  a  positive  relationship  found  between fine motor skills and academic achievement in NT children (Cameron et al., 2012). Therefore, fidget spinners could indi -rectly  support  success  in  the  classroom  by  enhancing  fine\n\nmotor skills, or they could hinder children's ability to engage in classroom activities by requiring attention and can there -fore contribute negatively to learning experiences.\n\nOnly one study to date has considered children's sensory processing and the effects of fidget tools to improve attention and arithmetic performance with 271 Dutch primary school children aged seven to eight years old (van der Wurff et al., 2021). Three sensory tools were chosen (tangle, ear muffs and wobble cushion) for children to utilise during test condi -tions. It was predicted that the wobble cushion and the tangle to be beneficial for participants with a high sensory threshold and categorised with registration and sensory seeking pat -terns.  In  contrast,  the  earmuffs  were  expected  to  be  effec -tive for children with a low threshold who are sensitive to stimuli or avoid sensation (sensitivity and avoiding patterns). However, there were no positive effects of any of the sensory tools and even some evidence of impaired performance.\n\n## Harmfulness\n\nThe increased concern of fidget toy use could be linked to the reported risks of the toys. The marketers of the fidget spin -ner  failed  to  provide  any  warnings  associated  with  misuse of the toy. After undergoing examination, it was concluded that  some fidget spinners may elicit nickel- or cobalt aller -gic contact dermatitis (Ahlstr\u00f6m et al., 2018), and due to the increasing number of injuries emerging related to fidget spin -ners, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) issued formal public safety tips concerning the ingestion of fidget spinner parts (Khalaf et al., 2018). The literature con -cerning school policy forbidding fidget spinners is predomi -nantly focussed on the negative impact they have on students' education and their physical hazards (Schecter et al., 2017).\n\n## The current study\n\nAlthough previous research has examined the impact of the use of fidget toys in clinical and educational settings, the ben -efits and risks of fidget toy use are of ongoing debate as there is  insufficient  evidence  to  suggest  whether  fidget  toys  help or hinder children's emotional wellbeing and academic prog -ress. In particular, very few studies have examined whether the use and benefit might depend upon the person's sensory pro -file or neurodivergence. The current novel study will address this  gap  by  examining  the  perspectives  on  fidget  toys  and spinners by parents of autistic children and NT children. This research will establish, for the first time, whether children's sensory-seeking  profile  will  determine  the  effectiveness  of fidget  toy  use.  It  was  hypothesised  that  parents  of  autistic children (compared to NT parents) will perceive fidget toys and spinners to be (1) more beneficial, (2) help concentra -tion (Slater, 2012) and to (3) reduce anxiety (Fletcher-Watson &amp; May, 2018) due to the sensory needs of autistic children.\n\nFurthermore, parents of NT children will view fidget toys as (4) more harmful (Schecter et al., 2017) and (5) more likely to cause a distraction (Hulsac et al., 2020) compared to parents of autistic children. Finally, parents will perceive fidget toys to be (6) more beneficial for children who have higher sen -sory seeking scores (van der Wurff et al., 2021).\n\n## Method\n\n## Participants\n\n184 parents and carers of children aged between 3 and 16 were  recruited  via  online  platforms.  Respondents  ( n = 55) were excluded from the data analysis if they did not complete any questions beyond the demographics section (section A), if their child did not meet the age criteria of 3-16 years old, if their child had ADHD in addition to ASD (due to sensory needs being largely associated with ADHD) and finally, if they lived outside of the UK. The final sample included 129 respondents (76 respondents for NT children and 53 respon -dents  for  autistic  children).  Table 1  provides  demographic information about the children that they reported about.\n\n## Materials\n\nThe survey was piloted amongst five parents and five pro -fessionals, participants were asked the following questions: (1)  What  they  thought  of  the  questions,  (2)  Whether  the order made sense, (3) What questions they found difficult to answer and (4) Any question they had expected but were not asked. The responses to this pilot study informed and confirmed  the  research  parameters  were  appropriate.  The survey contained four sections: section A asked for demo -graphic information about their child (e.g., child's date of\n\nTable 1 Demographic information about the respondents' children\n\n| Group                              | Autistic ( n = 53)   | Autistic ( n = 53)   | NT ( n = 76)   | NT ( n = 76)   |\n|------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Total                              |                      |                      |                |                |\n| Child's gender                     | Female               | Male                 | Female         | Male           |\n| N%                                 | 15 (28%)             | 38 (72%)             | 38 (50%)       | 38 (50%)       |\n| Child's age (average years;        | 9.85 (3.45)          | 9.85 (3.45)          | 8.76 (3.43)    | 8.76 (3.43)    |\n| Children with additional diagnosis | 19 (36%)             | 19 (36%)             | 7 (9%)         | 7 (9%)         |\n| Child's type of schooling          |                      |                      |                |                |\n| Mainstream                         | 17                   | 32%                  | 66             | 87%            |\n| Mainstream with SEN                | 25                   | 47%                  | 9              | 12%            |\n| Special school                     | 7                    | 13%                  | 0              | 0%             |\n| Other                              | 4                    | 8%                   | 1              | 1%             |\n\nNote: Other co-occuring conditions for the autistic group included anxiety, Tourette's syndrome, dyslexia, delayed speech, dyspraxia, asthma,  hyperopia,  Marfan's  syndrome  and  22q11.1  deletion  syn -drome\n\nbirth, gender, whether they were autistic or NT and type of schooling  they  attended).  In  section  B  respondents  rated statements  about  the  uses,  benefits,  and  risks  of  fidget toys in general using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = definitely yes, 2 = yes,  3 = maybe, 4 = not  very  much, 5 = not  at  all). Respondents  were  then  required  to  respond  to  the  same statements but about the uses, benefits, and risks of fidget spinners for their child (see Online Resource 1 for the statements  used).  Section  C  included  demographic  questions about the respondent (e.g., relationship to child, geographi -cal location). In the final section respondents completed the Child Sensory Profile questionnaire 2 (Dunn, 2014) which is designed to evaluate the sensory needs of children based on nine sections; auditory, visual, touch, movement, body position,  oral,  conduct,  social  emotional  attention.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 8765, "end_char_idx": 17395, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "------------------\nMetadata:\n{metadata_str}\n\nContent:\n\n{content}\n------------------", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c3bfd594-23d6-4ee9-9c43-e6ff601299a3": {"__data__": {"id_": "c3bfd594-23d6-4ee9-9c43-e6ff601299a3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\s12144-023-05483-3.pdf", "file_name": "s12144-023-05483-3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1026220, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dd110ed1-a02d-4bc5-af97-dc62801740e2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\s12144-023-05483-3.pdf", "file_name": "s12144-023-05483-3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1026220, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "1a46fa8049d4dc9cb62dd88a30fa6db268b25c09daedb2141363c4746e0efc51", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cedd69cf-c1c0-46a9-bd38-9b34837905db", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\s12144-023-05483-3.pdf", "file_name": "s12144-023-05483-3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1026220, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "5b05cbf782fd8bb142bb2d4320c497295fbf6157388afcd6f51b2648a01dcea6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7dcd2a5e-7861-4b34-bcd2-90672ffea904", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "882f74a5033a1cf1cb59a553947cca92afa2e1b87abff3b29752b5c0608e1fdc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Parent /  carer responses were measured on a 6-point Likert scale against the sensory quadrants assigned to individuals based on the frequency of sensory behaviours occurring (0 = N/A, 1 = Almost never/10% or less (no quadrant), 2 = Occasionally/ 25% (registration), 3 = Half the time/ 50% (sensitivity), 4 = Frequently/ 75% (avoiding), 5 = Always/ 90% or more (seeking).  The  quadrants  were  calculated  in  accordance with the sensory profile manual.\n\n## Design and procedure\n\nEthical  approval  was  obtained  from  Kingston  University. Parents  and  carers  were  contacted  through  the  distribu -tion of a flyer which contained survey details via schools, social media sites and personal contacts. Respondents were required  to  access  the  survey  using  the  URL  link  on  the flyer. The survey was completed using Qualtrics. The online self-report survey contained open and closed ended ques -tions. An  information  sheet  which  included  details  of  the study was at the beginning of the survey. Respondents were made aware that the purpose of the study was to investigate the benefits and risks of fidget toy use. Participants signed an  online  consent  form  before  answering  any  questions. At the end of each survey, participants were directed to a debrief sheet which thanked them for their participation and gave the contact details of the research team in case there were any further questions or if the participant wanted to withdraw their data from the study. The survey took approx -imately 20 min to complete.\n\n## Data Analysis\n\nStatistical  analysis  of  quantitative  data  was  performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences software (SPSS).  Chi-square  tests  were  run  to  investigate  the  per -spectives between parents of autistic children and parents of NT children. Cross-tabulations were produced to explore the proportions of participants' answers using a five-point Likert scale (1 = definitely  yes,  2 = yes,  3 = maybe, 4 = not very much, 5 = not at all). Due to the small sample size, a Spearman's rho correlation was run to establish if there was a relationship between responses from parents about their child using a five-point Likert scale and the sensory seek -ing scores from the Sensory Profile questionnaire 2 (Dunn, 2014). The Likert scores were reversed for the correlational analyses to facilitate the interpretation of the results.\n\n## Results\n\n## Differences between the groups of respondents\n\nTwo groups of participants were examined; respondents of autistic children ( N = 53) and those of NT children ( n = 76). Comparisons  of  the  child's  gender  revealed  that  there were more males in the autistic group than the NT group, \u03c7 2 (1) = 6.073, p = .018.  Age  comparisons  revealed  no  sig -nificant difference between the two groups of children that respondents  completed  the  questions  on, t (127) = 1.771, p = .079.  Respondents were more likely to report that their child  had  additional  diagnoses  in  the  autistic  group  than the NT group, \u03c7 2 (1) = 13.769, p &lt; .001. The unstandardised residuals that were calculated for the type of schooling the children attended showed fewer NT children in a mainstream setting  with  SEN  unit  and  more  in  mainstream  education compared to the autistic group, \u03c7 2 (3) = 41.413, p &lt; .001.\n\nIn order to establish whether the children in both groups (autistic and NT) have a similar experience of fidget toy and fidget spinner use, respondents were asked to report whether they have used a fidget toy/spinner and the frequency of their child's use. As can be seen in Online Resource 2, there was no significant difference in whether they had used fidget toys in general, \u03c7 2 (1) = 1.985, p = .205 or the use of fidget spin -ners \u03c7 2 (1) = 1.066, p = .302  between the two groups. How -ever, in terms of frequency and how often the toys were used, unstandardised residuals showed that the autistic group were less likely to never use fidget toys and the NT group were less likely to use it more than once aweek. This showed that autistic children used fidget toys more than NT children.\n\n## Benefits and risks related to fidget toys\n\nA chi-square test of independence revealed that there was a significant association between having an autistic child and perceiving fidget toys to be more beneficial than having a NT child, \u03c7 2 (4) = 26.456, p &lt; .001. The cross tabulations in Table 2 reveal that a larger proportion of respondents for the autistic group responded with 'definitely yes' in 15 out of 53 (28%) compared to 4 out of 76 (5%) for respondents in the\n\nNT group. Overall, respondents in the NT group were more likely to respond that fidget toys were 'not at all' (8%), 'not very much' (20%) and 'maybe' (26%) beneficial for their child.\n\nThere was also a significant group difference for perceiv -ing fidget toys as helping with concentration; \u03c7 2 (4) = 16.148, p = .003. Respondents in the autistic group were more likely to  respond  that 'yes' (34%)  and 'definitely  yes' (13%)  to fidget toys aiding concentration in comparison to NT par -ents responding 'yes' (14%) and 'definitely yes' (1%).\n\nThere  was  a  significant  finding  for  anxiety  responses, \u03c7 2 (4) = 17.478, p = .002 with more respondents of autistic children  reporting 'yes' (32%)  or  ' definitely  yes' (30%) that fidget toys reduce anxiety for their child, in contrast to respondents of NT children with 13% reporting 'yes' and 9% with 'definitely yes' .  Chi-square tests of independence revealed that no significance was observed for respondents of NT children viewing fidget toys as more harmful, caus -ing more of a distraction or for being reported as fun than respondents of autistic children (see Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Perspectives on the benefits and risks of fidget toys for the respondents' child\n\n| Group                                                        |                | Autistic n (%)   | NT n (%)   | Group difference            |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|------------------|------------|-----------------------------|\n| Fidget toys are beneficial for my child                      |                |                  |            | \u03c7 2 (4) = 26.456, p < .001. |\n|                                                              | Definitely yes | 15 (28%)         | 4 (5%)     |                             |\n|                                                              | Yes            | 21 (40%)         | 13 (17%)   |                             |\n|                                                              | Maybe          | 4 (8%)           | 20 (26%)   |                             |\n|                                                              | Not very much  | 5 (9%)           | 15 (20%)   |                             |\n|                                                              | Not at all     | 1 (2%)           | 6 (8%)     |                             |\n| Fidget toys help my child to concentrate on the task at hand |                |                  |            | \u03c7 2 (4) = 16.148, p = .003. |\n|                                                              | Definitely yes | 7 (13%)          | 1 (1%)     |                             |\n|                                                              | Yes            | 18 (34%)         | 11 (14%)   |                             |\n|                                                              | Maybe          | 10 (19%)         | 25 (33%)   |                             |\n|                                                              | Not very much  | 8 (15%)          | 7 (9%)     |                             |\n|                                                              | Not at all     | 5 (9%)           | 14 (18%)   |                             |\n| Fidget toys distract my child from the task at hand          |                |                  |            | \u03c7 2 (4) = 4.635, p = .327.  |\n|                                                              | Definitely yes | 1 (2%)           | 4 (5%)     |                             |\n|                                                              | Yes            | 3 (6%)           | 10 (13%)   |                             |\n|                                                              | Maybe          | 21 (40%)         | 20 (26%)   |                             |\n|                                                              | Not very much  | 9 (17%)          | 9 (12%)    |                             |\n|                                                              | Not at all     | 13 (25%)         | 15 (20%)   |                             |\n| Fidget toys reduce anxiety for my child                      |                |                  |            | \u03c7 2 (4) = 17.478, p = .002.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 17397, "end_char_idx": 26254, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "------------------\nMetadata:\n{metadata_str}\n\nContent:\n\n{content}\n------------------", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7dcd2a5e-7861-4b34-bcd2-90672ffea904": {"__data__": {"id_": "7dcd2a5e-7861-4b34-bcd2-90672ffea904", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project -

However,  the  risks  of  fidget  toys  were  seen  to  cause  too much of a distraction for the user and other children if they are used in a class setting. Respondents commented on their misuse and how they could provide health hazards such as choking.\n\n## Benefits and risks related to fidget spinners\n\nA chi-square test of independence revealed that there was a significant association between having an autistic child and perceiving fidget spinners to be more beneficial than having a NT child, \u03c7 2 (4) = 12.376, p = .015. The cross tabulations in Table 3 reveal that respondents for the autistic group were more likely to say 'definitely yes' with 6 out of 53 (11%) responses compared to 2 out of 76 (3%) responses in the NT group. The autistic group was also more likely to say 'yes' with 30% for the autistic group and only 9% for the NT group.\n\nRespondents of NT children perceived fidget spinners to be more fun for their child than respondents of   autistic chil -dren, \u03c7 2 (4) = 10.100, p = .039. Similar to fidget toy analyses, there was a significant finding for fidget spinners reducing anxiety for the autistic group compared to the NT group, \u03c7 2 (4) = 17.157, p = .002.\n\nChi-square  tests  of  independence  revealed  that  no  sig -nificance  was  observed  for  the  autistic  group  concerning fidget  spinners  helping  concentration.  There  was  also  no significance found for respondents of NT children viewing fidget toys as more harmful or causing more of a distraction ( p &gt; .1). See Table 3 for all fidget spinner analyses.\n\n## Relationship between respondents' perceptions and children's sensory profiles\n\nIt  was  predicted  that  there  would  be  a  positive  relation -ship between autistic children's sensory seeking scores and whether their respondents perceived fidget toys to be more beneficial, and similarly a positive relationship between sen -sory seeking scores and for fidget toys increasing concentra -tion and reducing anxiety. A sub-sample of the respondents completed the Sensory Profile Questionnaire 2 (Dunn, 2014) for their child ( n = 37 for autistic group and n = 42 for NT group). Autistic  children  had  significantly  higher  sensory seeking  scores  ( M = 51.19, SD = 17.02)  compared  to  NT children ( M = 24.024, SD = 18.15), t (77) = 6.834, p &lt; .001.\n\nIn order to observe whether sensory processing difficul -ties impact on the use of fidget toys and fidget spinners as well as the views of the respondents, we examined if there were any differences in the children's sensory seeking score in relation to their fidget toy use in each group (autistic and NT). Autistic  children  who  used  a  fidget  toy  ( n = 30)  did not have higher sensory seeking scores, compared to those who did not ( n = 7), F (1, 9.931) = 4.337, p = .064. Similarly, there was no difference in sensory seeking score between the NT children who used a fidget toy ( n = 32),  compared to those who did not ( n = 10), t (40) = -0.942, p = .352. For the fidget spinner, there was a difference in sensory seeking scores, F (1,27.502) = 6.245, p = .019 between autistic chil -dren who use a fidget spinner ( n = 14) and those who do not ( n = 25). This was not the case for the NT group, as children who used a fidget spinner ( n = 17) did not differ from those who did not use a fidget spinner ( n = 25)  in  their  sensory seeking scores, F (1,  24.722) = 1.965, p = .173  (see  Online Resource 3 for mean scores).\n\nTo examine whether parental agreement with the state -ments relating to fidget toys and spinners being beneficial, helping concentration and reducing anxiety for their child related to their child's sensory seeking scores, non-paramet -ric spearman rho's one-tailed correlations were run for each group separately (see Table 4). First, correlations explored the statements about fidget toys for my child and the child's sensory seeking score. In the autistic group, there was a sig -nificant positive correlation between parents' rating of how beneficial  fidget  toys  are  and  sensory  seeking  scores;  the higher the sensory seeking score, the more parents agreed that  fidget  toys  were  beneficial, r (36) = 0.398, p = .008. For those with higher sensory seeking scores, respondents reported that fidget toys were less harmful; there was a sig -nificant  negative  correlation  between  harmful  ratings  and sensory  seeking  scores, r (37) = -0.445, p = .003.  There was also a significant positive correlation between parents' agreement that fidget toys reduce anxiety and their child's sensory seeking score, r (37) = 0.521, p = &lt; .001. The higher the sensory score, the more fidget toys were seen to reduce anxiety. All other correlations were not significant ( p &gt; .05).\n\nSimilar to the autistic group, in the NT group, there was a significant positive correlation between respondents' agree -ment that fidget toys are beneficial for their child and sen -sory seeking scores, r (42) = 0.274, p = .040; the higher the sensory seeking score, the more beneficial fidget toys were perceived to be. In addition, there was a significant positive correlation  between  the  respondents'  rating  of  how  fidget toys help with concentration; the higher the child's sensory score,  the  more  fidget  toys  were  perceived  to  help  with concentration, r (42) = 0.411, p = .003. All other correlations were not significant ( p &gt; .05).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 26255, "end_char_idx": 34411, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template":

Findings of this study demonstrated that parents of autistic children perceived fidget toys and fidget spinners to be generally more beneficial than NT parents, especially in relation to reducing anxiety. They perceived fidget toys to improve concentration more than parents of NT children. Higher  sensory-seeking  scores  in  autistic  children  were associated with greater parental agreement for fidget toys and fidget spinners being beneficial, for fidget toys reduc -ing anxiety and being less harmful, and for fidget spinners being less distracting, whilst higher sensory scores in NT children were associated with better concentration. The cur -rent study shows that the perceived benefits of fidget toys depends on the sensory processing style of the child as well as  the  type  of  sensory  toy  involved,  which  suggests  that these individual differences need to be taken into account in school policies.\n\nAs expected, parents of autistic children perceived fidget toys and fidget spinners to be more beneficial in comparison to NT children. This finding corroborates previous research suggesting  that  autistic  children  display  difficulties  with sensory processing and often seek ways to stimulate their needs (Ashburner et al., 2008). Fidget toys have therefore been  offered  to  regulate  the  sensory  needs  of  individuals who need to expend energy or control impulses (Thompson &amp; Raisor, 2013).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 34353, "end_char_idx": 44336, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "------------------\nMetadata:\n{metadata_str}\n\nContent:\n\n{content}\n------------------", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d191ad73-7514-44ca-bc43-341e89cdc04e": {"__data__": {"id_": "d191ad73-7514-44ca-bc43-341e89cdc04e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\s12144-023-05483-3.pdf", "file_name": "s12144-023-05483-3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1026220, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dd110ed1-a02d-4bc5-af97-dc62801740e2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\s12144-023-05483-3.pdf", "file_name": "s12144-023-05483-3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1026220, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "1a46fa8049d4dc9cb62dd88a30fa6db268b25c09daedb2141363c4746e0efc51", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3955f237-0b55-43c1-95eb-08fdf75a05b7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\s12144-023-05483-3.pdf", "file_name": "s12144-023-05483-3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1026220, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "7e9497e24b0e3bfa629a8350384c05b9f87ae58b3f499e78dc2ea289017c616f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5ab82d64-8ac4-4be8-b380-53f4d65cd5a6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4c5f1fb92ff6e7ce427672d01e839e1e2edf8d743c58ee2e99c1ac447462aca3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Fidget toys have therefore been  offered  to  regulate  the  sensory  needs  of  individuals who need to expend energy or control impulses (Thompson &amp; Raisor, 2013). While previous studies found that fidget toys can improve concentration (Slater et al., 2012; Stalvey &amp; Brassell, 2006) and fidget spinners can negatively impact mathematical  ability  (Hulac  et  al.,  2020)  and  memory (Soares &amp; Storm, 2019) for NT children, no research to date has examined how fidget toys can benefit autistic individu -als.  The  current  study  evidenced  that  fidget  toys  are  per -ceived to help autistic children to concentrate; this is because their heightened sensory needs are accommodated, allowing them to focus on tasks. However, there was no difference between parents of autistic  and  NT  children  with  regards of viewing fidget spinners to help with concentration. This could be due to the fact that manipulating a fidget spinner requires fine motor skills and cognitive ability which again might  benefit  some  individuals  but  not  all  (Cohen  et  al., 2018). Therefore, the use of fidget spinners could be cog -nitively taxing when children are required to pay attention to a task. Open-ended responses by parents of NT children revealed that fidget spinners are generally considered as fad toys and fashionable items. This contrasts with the opinions of parents of autistic children in open-ended responses who acknowledged that fidget spinners could benefit those with sensory  needs.  However,  the  plethora  of  benefits  seen  by parents of autistic children for the use of fidget toys in gen -eral were not endorsed for fidget spinner use.\n\nIn regards to anxiety, our results indicate that parents of autistic children consider fidget toys and fidget spinners to reduce anxiety for their child more than parents of NT chil -dren. The current findings support the existing literature that autistic individuals are more likely to have anxiety and the use of fidget toys can help manage this (Hulac et al., 2020 ; Wood et al., 2020). Previous studies such as Da C\u00e2mara et al. (2018) found that NT children aged six to 11, choose a particular fidget toy to suit their emotional needs. For exam -ple, when a child is angry, they prefer a toy that they can squeeze. One parent in the autistic group commented that fidget spinners can be beneficial for children who like spin -ning things. So, although Da C\u00e2mara et al.'s (2018) study was not with autistic children, it could support the idea that the characteristics of fidget spinners could provide benefits such as satisfying anxious feelings for autistic children.\n\nSimilarly to the findings in the open-ended questions by parents of NT children, fidget spinners have been previously regarded as fad toys. Indeed, our findings also show that NT parents provide their children with fidget toys for enjoyment instead of for sensory needs.Yet, our correlational evidence suggests that parents of NT children who had higher sen -sory seeking profiles also perceived fidget toys to help with concentration.\n\nThere was no evidence to suggest that fidget toys or spin -ners were perceived to be harmful. A possible explanation for  this  is  that  the  term  'harmful'  could  be  considered  to have different meanings across the participant population. It could be interpreted that fidget spinners are harmful to chil -dren's educational outcomes in terms of their potential to distract (Soares &amp; Storm, 2019) rather than physical health risks (Reeves et al., 2018).\n\nWith the inclusion of sensory-seeking scores, we could ascertain that higher sensory-seeking scores in autistic chil -dren  were  associated  with  greater  parental  agreement  for fidget toys and spinners being beneficial, for fidget spinners being less distracting, for fidget toys as reducing anxiety and being  less  harmful.  Higher  sensory-seeking  scores  in  NT children were also associated with greater agreement that fidget toys were beneficial and for both fidget toys and spin -ners increasing concentration. These findings imply that the\n\nuse of a fidget toy and spinner can satisfy sensory needs of individuals who are sensory-seeking and therefore, require additional  stimulation  (Ashburner  et  al.,  2008),  whether they have a diagnosis or not.\n\n## Limitations and Future Research\n\nThe  current  study  sheds  light  on  an  area  that  requires more empirical research in order to eradicate the negative assumptions of fidget toy use which could potentially meet the needs of individuals with sensory processing difficulties who benefit from sensory-based intervention (Barton et al., 2015). Although the findings advance our understanding of fidget toy use, limitations were identified. The heterogeneity of the autistic population makes it difficult to generalise the findings to deduce that fidget toys will be beneficial for all autistic children. Our study showed that the benefits of sen -sory toys relate to the sensory-seeking profile of the autis -tic individual. However, other cognitive aspects could also play a role in whether fidget toys provide any benefits (i.e., overall intellectual abilities or working memory abilities). Much of the research surrounding fidget  toy/  spinner  use takes place within clinical or educational settings, this could explain why there is limited research detailing parental per -ceptions. Although our study is the first to examine parental perceptions, parents might not observe the use of fidget toys at home as a focus tool in comparison to the school environ -ment where students are given fidget toys to help complete tasks.  In  addition,  Schecter  et  al.  (2017)  pointed  out  that some schools have banned the use of fidget spinners due to the scientifically unfounded nature of their perceived ben -efits. It is thus possible that parental perceptions might be influenced by their child's school policy and what has been reported in the media. As such, questions relating to concen -tration and distraction could be unreliable because children might not be required to concentrate in the home as much as in school and parents might not be as reliable when it comes to observing the benefits of fidget toys and spinners. Still, it is important to examine parental views as parents are key stakeholders  in  a  child's  development  and  learning  and  a family-centred approach to education is vital for the success of autistic students (Hagner et al., 2012).\n\nFuture research should directly observe the use of fidget toys and spinners during cognitive tasks in order to assess whether they positively impact academic progress. It would also be advantageous to gain the opinions of autistic chil -dren to find out why and when they would choose to use a fidget toy and how it satisfies their needs. Younger children are  exposed  to  learning  through  play  (Ailwood,  2003)  so they are receiving ways to self-regulate. It would therefore be interesting to identify whether older children are more in need of fidget toys because they are not readily available during their learning experiences. Furthermore, future stud -ies could examine a child's severity of autism and whether they are sensory seeking and benefit from fidget toy use.\n\n## Implications\n\nThe  findings  from  the  current  study  highlight  the  impor -tance of taking an individual-centred approach to the ben -efits and use of fidget toys in that all children with higher sensory seeking behaviours might benefit from fidget toys, but especially autistic children and that the type of fidget toy may serve different functions, with fidget spinners helping to  reduce  anxiety  whilst  other  fidget  toys  might  be  better to  aid  concentration.  This  finding  stresses  the  importance of reducing the misconception that fidgeting will generally cause a lack of focus (Pine et al., 2007). This is important as previous beliefs and misconceptions could affect whether parents and professionals allow the use of fidget toys but also impact on the child's choice to use them to satisfy their sensory needs. In Da C\u00e2mara et al.'s (2018) study, children chose  fidget  items  that  they  thought  parents  and  teachers would approve of, such as items that did not look like toys and were accessible within the classroom or at home (pen -cils,  rubbers  and  hair  ties).  Seeing  that  fidget  toys  have  a number of benefits, especially for those with sensory seek -ing  profiles,  access  to  fidget  toys  would  be  advantageous for social and emotional purposes (Fletcher-Watson &amp; May, 2018) as well as for successful learning inside and outside of the classroom environment (Blair &amp; Diamond, 2008).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis study was the first of its kind in gaining parental per -spectives on fidget toy and fidget spinner use for autistic and NT children.

In this study, we aimed to identify the needs of autistic children during healthcare participation and, based on the findings, generate solutions to improve participation in healthcare.\n\nMethods A design-thinking approach with qualitative methods was used. First, observation of the environment and journey mapping were completed as part of the empathy stage of design thinking. Next, six parents of autistic children completed semi-structured interviews. The interviews were transcribed, and thematic analysis was used to identify themes. Next, healthcare providers participated in a group session to discuss experiences caring for autistic children. These data were also analyzed using qualitative methods, and themes emerged. Finally, healthcare providers and five interior design and architecture professionals reviewed the themes from both groups and the best available literature. They participated in a brainstorming session where solutions were collaboratively generated.\n\nResults Four main themes emerged from the parent's interviews, and three themes emerged from the healthcare provider's input. Several solutions were identified during the brainstorming session, including a prototype for a sensory adaptive environment, sensory adaptations during medical procedures, and training for providers on sensory features in autism.\n\nConclusion The design thinking method was appropriate to identify the problem and potential solutions to improve participation in healthcare for autistic children.\n\nKeywords Autism\u00a0\u00b7 Sensory adaptive environments\u00a0\u00b7 Occupational therapy\u00a0\u00b7 Design thinking\u00a0\u00b7 Healthcare\u00a0\u00b7 Participation\n\nAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is the most common neurodevelopmental disorder in childhood [4]. Up to 84% of autistic persons experience sensory features [5]. These include hyper- or hypo-reactivity to sensations such as touch, smell, movement, and sounds, unusual interest in the sensory aspects of objects and the environment, and difficulty integrating two or more sensory experiences simultaneously [5, 26, 27]. Participation in healthcare is essential to maintain optimal health and well-being. However, healthcare can be an overwhelming experience for autistic persons experiencing sensory features [11]. Stimuli in a healthcare setting, such as bright lights, sounds, smells, touch, and even pain, can generate discomfort and induce sensory overload, anxiety, and trigger stress responses that can cause unsafe behaviors and interactions [10, 30]. Further, the demands of multiple, simultaneous integration of stimuli can create challenges\n\n* Lady Rios-Vega, lady.rios-vega@jefferson.edu | 1 Department of\u00a0Occupational Therapy, Jefferson Autism Center of\u00a0Excellence, Philadelphia, PA\u00a019107, USA. 2 Department of\u00a0Emergency Medicine, Thomas Jefferson University, 901 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, PA\u00a019107, USA. 3 Menninger Department of\u00a0Psychiatry and\u00a0Behavioral Sciences, The Department of\u00a0Pediatrics, Baylor College of\u00a0Medicine, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX\u00a077030, USA.\n\nVol.:(0123456789)\n\nin understanding and following directions and other aspects of participation in healthcare. As a result, some autistic individuals and their families refrain from medical care to prevent negative behaviors and experiences, leading to poor health outcomes [30].\n\nMost healthcare settings do not provide an environment that accommodates and supports the autistic population's unique sensory needs [10]. Furthermore, most healthcare providers do not thoroughly understand sensory features and their impact on behavior and thus do not provide needed accommodations. This can place autistic children, their families, and providers at risk for ineffective service delivery [10].\n\nOne strategy utilized to address sensory features and improve participation in activities is the implementation of sensory adaptative environments. These adaptations are designed to allow children with sensory needs to have control of the environment and assist with self-regulation [12, 20, 21, 30]. Adaptations are thoughtfully designed and include adaptations to an existing environment or the development of a new sensory adaptive environment [9]. There is no 'one-size-fits-all' solution, but rather adaptations that meet the individual's and the facility's needs.\n\nWood et\u00a0al. [30] and Cermak et\u00a0al. [7] found that sensory adaptations in the physical environment improved participation in the emergency room and dental office settings, respectively. They discovered that adaptations such as a quiet room equipped with sensory-friendly elements, including dim lights, soothing sounds, and opportunities for pressure touch (i.e., a weighted butterfly cocoon worn during the dental visit), rocking chairs, and a variety of small manipulative hand toys, can positively impact participation and interaction. Furthermore, Cermak et\u00a0al. [7] found that using this sensory-adapted equipment improved participation in dental healthcare for this population and decreased sensory discomfort and behavioral distress.\n\nSensory adaptations can be implemented in a variety of settings and in a variety of different ways. In their study, Wood et\u00a0al. [30] implemented environmental adaptations to assist autistic individuals with sensory needs as soon as they arrived at the emergency room. These included adaptations such as alternative sitting options (ball, mat, stretcher, mat on the floor), showing a picture list of available sensory toys, and offering devices like a white noise machine during medical procedures. These feasible and low-cost adaptations helped patients safely complete medical procedures [30]. Litwin and Sellen [15] implemented sensory kits in a pediatric emergency room using a sound machine, a tablet with calming photos, small hand toys, and multiple transportable items for all sensory systems. They found a substantial need for these sensory adaptations, particularly in crowded environments and during waiting periods, and parents and participants indicated high satisfaction with the adaptations implemented during the visits.\n\nCollaboration among stakeholders is critical for implementing sensory adaptations [7, 30]. Often, occupational therapists and interior design experts help develop unique environmental adaptations and can contribute to more successful outcomes, including increased participation in healthcare and decreased stress, anxiety, and stereotyped behaviors [21]. Design Thinking (DT) is an innovative approach that uses multidisciplinary collaboration to solve problems by generating empathy for clients [2, 8]. It is rooted in participatory design [16, 28]. DT has now been adopted in healthcare and is a preferred method for stakeholder engagement because of its collaborative, iterative process and its value for diversity to generate meaningful solutions [23, 25]. DT seeks to understand the needs through the engagement of stakeholders [2, 25]. The goal of DT is to solve complex problems efficiently, innovatively, and collaboratively to develop client-centered, meaningful solutions [2, 25].\n\nThis project aimed to identify the needs of autistic children during healthcare participation using a collaborative, innovative approach and use these data to generate solutions to improve participation during healthcare visits. The findings from this study serve as guidance to address the needs of autistic children in various settings beyond healthcare.\n\n## 1    Methods\n\n## 1.1    Ethical approval\n\nEthics approval for this project was granted by the Thomas Jefferson University Institutional Review Board in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants in the study.\n\n## 1.2    Study design\n\nThe project utilized qualitative methodology with a design-thinking (DT) approach to engage stakeholders in a collaborative, interactive process. Following DT methodology, which included observations of the existing environment, interviews with families, and discussion and brainstorming with the healthcare providers and design experts. Qualitative analysis was used to identify themes from parent interviews and professional discussions. This process allowed for an opportunity to collect data from multiple sources and develop responsive solutions.\n\n## 1.3    Setting\n\nThis study occurred in 2021 at an autism center, part of a children's healthcare network, and in collaboration with a large urban university. The autism center opened in late 2018 and provides pediatric developmental, psychological, and psychiatric care. The professionals at the center work closely with other specialists, such as physical, occupational, speech, and assistive technology, to create customized care plans to manage the child's needs and promote independence [3]. The center was designed to accommodate autistic children's needs with a visually appealing environment, clutter-free, and way-finding makers throughout. The center provides some sensory adaptations, such as adaptive seating in the waiting room and lighting adjustments, but was seeking ideas to improve participation in healthcare for the autistic population. Most of the meetings for this project took place remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, except for the journey map (described below), which was completed in person by the first author in collaboration with the autism center medical director.\n\n## 1.4    Participants\n\nParticipants included parents or caregivers of autistic children attending the autism center (n = 6), healthcare professionals (n = 15), and professionals in design and architecture (n = 5). Parents were recruited via convenience sampling from the autism center's patient pool. Individuals received an email with the study information in English and Spanish. Interested individuals replied to the email and completed a phone screening in their preferred language to determine eligibility and to set up an interview time. Verbal informed consent of eligible participants was obtained before the interview and stored in a university password-protected file following the Institutional Review Board (IRB) standards.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 10561, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "------------------\nMetadata:\n{metadata_str}\n\nContent:\n\n{content}\n------------------", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "44ede386-2c07-4722-9916-70fa2126891a": {"__data__": {"id_": "44ede386-2c07-4722-9916-70fa2126891a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\s44202-024-00118-5.pdf", "file_name": "s44202-024-00118-5.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 899379, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "af0963f0-7fae-4d57-9509-367a8c21d51b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\s44202-024-00118-5.pdf", "file_name": "s44202-024-00118-5.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 899379, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "62ccdfb58073f6baeaa29025873949885eb6dd76ef1af8ea9e8ddb2b09488e30", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "40290e3c-db4c-4bc1-beea-0c61b19ab068", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\s44202-024-00118-5.pdf", "file_name": "s44202-024-00118-5.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 899379, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "612eac599e0712d5f3c2b6d7f3dd87f68c5c04a25cf57cbfa3f7bc852704a9b8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1214d5ea-2d18-4fd0-94f3-9bf0365e0740", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7c8d5b9ecf2ba7d0f11932b8f5a6d607d4c8288d1e1e3115eeb72769fd6adcd6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Verbal informed consent of eligible participants was obtained before the interview and stored in a university password-protected file following the Institutional Review Board (IRB) standards. Parents were eligible if they had a child with a diagnosis of autism between the ages of 3 and 10\u00a0years old and were currently receiving services at the center. Autism diagnoses were made by professionals at the center who are trained and qualified in autism diagnosis. Six individuals were eligible and agreed to participate. Three identified as Caucasian, one as Black/ African American, and two as Hispanic/Latino. Four participants completed interviews in English and two in Spanish.\n\nConvenience sampling was used to recruit healthcare providers, interior designers, and architects. An email was sent, and those who replied to the email were screened, provided an overview of the project, and consented. Nine occupational therapists, three medical doctors, one nurse, one psychologist, one child life specialist, three interior designers, and two architects were eligible and agreed to participate.\n\n## 1.5    Procedures\n\nAs shown in Fig.\u00a01 below, the project followed the DT phases: Empathize , understands the user and the challenges; Define, frames the problem and the desired outcome; Ideate, seeks to generate as many solutions as possible to address the problem ; Prototype, crafts potential solutions to make them tangible for testing and Test, implements the solutions identified and evaluates the effectiveness [2, 25]. In this paper, we present phase one of a two-phased project presenting findings from the stages of empathizing, defining, ideating, and prototyping. The testing phase will be part of the project's second phase and will be implemented in the future.\n\nDuring the empathize stage, a journey map was developed to understand the child's and parent's healthcare experience. Journey mapping is a technique utilized to visualize the process one goes through to complete an activity or a goal [13]. The journey map was developed in collaboration with autism center staff to visually represent the process of the healthcare visit. The map was created using photos of the center's physical environment and describing the usual healthcare visit steps. The journey map is shown in the results section.\n\nAlso, during the empathize stage, parent interviews were conducted via phone in English and Spanish, according to the participant's selected preferred language. Interviews followed a semi-structured format with questions designed\n\nFig. 1 Design thinking approach\n\nto learn about the experiences of participation. After learning about the child's age, diagnosis, and frequency of visits, questions focused on learning about their experiences obtaining health care at the center. Questions such as Can you describe a typical visit? Does the visit present any challenges? Do you use any strategies when presented with a challenge? How does the experience influence your child's behavior? Lastly, as part of this stage, the healthcare providers discussed experiences during service delivery to autistic children at the center. This group meeting occurred before the brainstorming session and differed from the parent interviews completed individually.\n\nDuring the define stage, thematic analysis of the parent interview data and the provider group discussion data were completed (see data analysis for more detail). Additionally, a literature review was conducted on autism, sensory features, and participation in healthcare to inform the process further.\n\nIn the ideate stage, 15 healthcare providers, three designers, and two architects met via Zoom [31]. All professionals were English speakers. They were presented with the themes identified from the parent interviews, the themes identified by the providers, and the result of the literature review. Further, the group watched training videos on sensory integration and sensory interventions to understand sensory needs.\n\nCollaborative brainstorming occurred in the same group session and with the same members. Two design-thinking experts guided this. One expert was the director of the design lab at an urban university, and the second expert was a member of this lab. The goal of brainstorming was to generate as many potential solutions as possible using the information available. Participants used an online collaborative whiteboard platform [17] to add pictures, use sticky notes with ideas, and make drawings.\n\nLastly, in the prototype stage, the DT experts guided the group through a ranking process of the ideas and solutions, discussed desirability, feasibility, and viability, and created a final prototype with the solutions.\n\n## 1.6    Data analysis\n\nThematic analysis was used for the parent interviews and the healthcare provider group session following recommendations from Castleberry et\u00a0al. [6] and Nowell et\u00a0al. [18]. Interview recordings were transcribed using specialized software (Otter.ai) [19]. Transcripts were reviewed for accuracy and uploaded to the NVivo platform, a software program to organize the information, develop codes, and identify themes [29]. Data were reviewed multiple times. The rigor of the qualitative analysis was accomplished through data triangulation (implementing various sources to analyze and understand the data) [14]. Peer debriefing (a presentation and discussion of the data with a peer not involved in the project) was completed to obtain objective input [14]. Bias was reduced following the process of reflexivity [14, 18], by recording reflections on the personal views of the primary researcher and acknowledging bias.\n\n## 2    Results\n\n## 2.1    The journey map\n\nThe journey map is depicted below (Fig.\u00a02). Journey mapping showed a typical visit follows six steps: (1) Transition from the home to the center. For children with sensory differences, transitions from the house to the car or public transportation to the center require preparation and can be overwhelming. (2) Arrival at the center. This is where patients sign in and\n\nFig. 2 Journey Map. 1. Pictures taken by PI at Swank Autism Center in Wilmington, DE, 2021\n\nwait in a waiting room area with bright lighting, a television, and a small table. Families with their children must stay in the waiting area until they are called to the vitals room. (3) Vital signs. Taking vital signs occurs in a room with two adultsize chairs, a treatment table, and adjustable lighting. Usually, toys are available in this room, but they were removed to protect sanitation during the pandemic. (4) Transition to the treatment room. In this next step, children transition to a brightly lit treatment room (lights can be dimmed if needed) with one or two tables and regular office chairs. (5) Further treatment or testing. Additional testing and intervention that may be needed are provided in the same visit for some children. This means they must transition to another treatment room with similar physical characteristics. (6) Leaving the center. In the last step, children and their families leave the room, walk through long hallways following the colored lines leading to the exit, stop at the check-out desk, and leave the center.\n\n## 2.2    Parent/caregiver themes\n\nFour themes emerged from the parent interviews\n\nEnvironment challenges in the physical and social environment interfere with participation in healthcare. About the physical environment, data revealed that additional adaptations are needed to address the unique sensory needs of autistic children. Statements such as 'Bright lights [in the center] bother my son and so [it triggers unwanted behaviors]' and 'The rooms are too bright, and he is sensitive to light.' indicate how physical environment features interfere with sensory needs and affect healthcare participation.\n\nParents identified that environmental modifications were needed to improve participation. Specific suggestions included an area with sensory items for children to take a break or self-regulate, a large variety of sensory toys and interactive objects in the exam room, and offering different colors and more natural light. 'a quiet room with different color lights and bubble walls'; 'Maybe if there were more sensory items available to occupy his attention while I was talking to the doctor, that would be helpful'; 'They need different kinds of sensory toys to interact in the rooms.' Specific types of equipment were also identified as strategies, such as rocking and calming chairs. 'they need to offer cocoon chairs and gel pads.'\n\nRegarding the social environment, parents noted that there needs to be more training among some clinical staff on sensory differences and strategies to address them.\n\nA second theme was regarding medical procedures . Data revealed that procedures such as measuring vital signs can be challenging and influence the appointment's course and future care. Parents expressed that 'taking the\n\ntemperature or blood pressure makes him react, and he can become aggressive, and he is not able to participate in the rest of the visit'; 'The temperature and blood pressure and all that stuff, like that is uncomfortable for her to do'; 'The blood pressure cuff starts squeezing her too hard, and she does not like that, affecting the full visit.' indicating the challenge autistic children and their families experience during the medical visit and expressing the need for adaptations to meet their unique sensory needs and complete medical procedures successfully and safely.\n\nA third theme is specific to sensory needs . Families expressed that their children experience unique sensory needs that can interfere with a successful healthcare visit. Some of those needs include 'he cannot be around people; I have to ask them for a room that is quiet,'; 'sounds bother him and can make the visit difficult,'; 'he is very much like a sensory seeker,' and [needs frequent stimulatory input]; 'he needs frequent oral input' [to stay regulated].\n\nThe last theme was related to timing . For some parents, implementing strategies before the visit helped with self-regulation, such as 'I give him my phone so that he can relax [before taking vitals].' for others, implementing strategies during the visit worked best.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 10370, "end_char_idx": 20624, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "------------------\nMetadata:\n{metadata_str}\n\nContent:\n\n{content}\n------------------", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1214d5ea-2d18-4fd0-94f3-9bf0365e0740": {"__data__": {"id_": "1214d5ea-2d18-4fd0-94f3-9bf0365e0740", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\s44202-024-00118-5.pdf", "file_name": "s44202-024-00118-5.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 899379, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "af0963f0-7fae-4d57-9509-367a8c21d51b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\s44202-024-00118-5.pdf", "file_name": "s44202-024-00118-5.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 899379, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "62ccdfb58073f6baeaa29025873949885eb6dd76ef1af8ea9e8ddb2b09488e30", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "44ede386-2c07-4722-9916-70fa2126891a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\s44202-024-00118-5.pdf", "file_name": "s44202-024-00118-5.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 899379, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "8c50368595ff0b9e6aa5b1244a1ef8e0c2a0c2e55ae3b150e8d61cad7d9f3451", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "72b99f1d-2f5f-44f8-9549-573d3a5ad5e0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bbc46957d1acf8ee607909a54c0ef0328f78ec87a4bd52643217f01ee280416e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "For some parents, implementing strategies before the visit helped with self-regulation, such as 'I give him my phone so that he can relax [before taking vitals].' for others, implementing strategies during the visit worked best.

However, for some parents, strategies worked best after the visit, such as giving the child sensory rewards for positive participation, 'I use a system of [sensory-related] rewards; I tell him, okay, if you sit still during the appointment, I will buy you a pack of gum.'\n\n## 2.3    Themes from\u00a0healthcare provider participation\n\nData collected from the provider's session was analyzed using the same qualitative approach followed by the parent interviews. The following themes were identified.\n\nProcedures , providers expressed the importance of routine procedures such as obtaining vital signs. However, they stated experiencing challenges due to sensory sensitivities and, in some cases, decreased understanding of the medical procedures. Some statements supporting this theme include: 'Taking vitals is a trigger, and the child becomes overwhelmed, making the visit very difficult'; 'I need vital signs, but it makes the patient unhappy; they have difficulty understanding why certain things are happening.' All healthcare professionals agreed that sensory differences significantly interfere with procedures and the course of the visit.\n\nAdditionally, providers indicated that 'long wait times can be unpredictable,' resulting in the patient having to wait longer and potentially becoming overwhelmed. Providers also indicated that 'time constraints' can impact their ability to deliver additional adaptations during medical procedures or to address sensory challenges.\n\nProviders agreed that more resources to address the sensory needs could positively impact participation. These included the 'availability of more sensory-friendly seating' and 'sensory strategies.' Of note, some sensory-friendly seating options were available at the center, but they were stored and out of sight during the pandemic. The providers stated that there is a 'spectrum of needs,' meaning that every child has different sensory needs, and a potential variety of sensory materials and adaptations is needed for improved outcomes in healthcare visits. They also expressed the need for more staff education about the sensory features of autism and potential challenges for those providing care.\n\nProviders agreed that modifications in the environment were necessary to improve health outcomes, describing solutions such as 'having a separate and quiet space' for those who have decreased tolerance to public spaces or 'a sensory adapted environment with sensory toys that are easy to clean' so children can freely interact and meet their unique needs and 'dynamic lighting with varied controls' in multiple healthcare spaces. Participants also suggested adaptations to medical procedures as an essential step to improve participation and decrease negative experiences. Some suggested that 'creating a social story' may prepare the child for the sensory experiences they would encounter during the medical visit. (The center was creating a social story at the time, but it had not yet been implemented). Others suggested that 'asking families about triggers when taking vitals' would be a helpful strategy or 'having a family member model vitals' could provide a visual model to help children understand the process of the medical procedures needed.\n\nFurther, providers expressed that communication is essential to improve care for autistic children. Some highlighted that 'communication is key' to learning more about the child's sensory needs. Others highlighted communication as being essential for healthcare providers and staff to 'learn effective communication techniques' when delivering care to families of autistic children. Providers also reflected on the importance of 'learning about the family's values and goals' to deliver client-centered care that meets the child's sensory needs and expectations for successful outcomes.\n\n## 2.4    Prototype development\n\nDuring the brainstorming session, three main solutions emerged: a Sensory Adaptive Environment (SAE), sensory adaptations during medical procedures, aiming vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, weight, and height measurements), and training for providers on sensory features in autism. For the SAE, the team identified that it should be implemented in an available room near the waiting room area. Participants with a background in interior design and architecture worked with the group to provide specific suggestions on the design and accessibility. Occupational therapists who are experts on environmental adaptations and sensory integration provided input on sensory equipment and potential activities to be incorporated into the SAE. Some suggestions were also developed using the literature presented during the session. Equipment suggestions were added using pictures of the equipment on the Miro platform. Other healthcare providers provided input on feasibility and use. A final SAE prototype emerged consisting of three different zones: (1) the calming/passive zone, (2) the active/exploratory zone, (3) and the midzone/transitioning zone, as described below and shown in Fig.\u00a03. These zones were named and described by the team during the prototype stage.\n\n## 2.4.1    The calming zone\n\nThe calming zone is designed for individuals who typically experience hyper-reactivity to sensations, mainly when presented with unfamiliar environments. The purpose of this zone is to provide a calming and relaxing environment. In this zone, the child will have access to equipment identified to provide calming sensations to facilitate self-regulatory experiences. Suggested equipment for this zone includes a lycra snuggle swing, a cushioned bubble tube base with visual elements such as fish and jellyfish, a bean bag chair, a weighted disc blanket, a fiber optic cascade, and fiber optic ceiling tiles.\n\n## 2.4.2    The active/exploratory zone\n\nThis zone is designed for children who may benefit from more active participation in sensory experiences and who usually seek sensory input. The purpose of this zone is to provide an exploratory environment. Children in this zone can interact with various equipment that provides the unique sensations they seek, intending to improve self-regulation and participation in healthcare. Suggested equipment for this zone includes rocking chairs, large marble panels, activity panels, a small trampoline, a climbing wall, and a swing.\n\nFig. 3 Sensory Adaptive Environment Prototype\n\n## 2.4.3    The midzone/transition zone\n\nThis zone is designed to be in the middle of the room with equipment that can provide calming or exploratory experiences. This zone also serves as a transition zone when children first enter the room to guide their needs and transition between the two other zones. Equipment for this zone includes a fiber optic tunnel, touch light panels, cocoon chairs, and other elements available, such as canceling headphones, tactile objects, a bin with toys (dinosaurs and cars were highly suggested by parents), and chewy tubes.\n\n## 3    Discussion\n\nParticipation in healthcare can be an overwhelming experience for autistic individuals and their families due to the sensory needs of the child and the sensory features of the environment. This study aimed to use stakeholder input to learn about autistic children's experiences when participating in healthcare and to design solutions to improve participation. We followed a design thinking approach to empathize with the participant's experiences, engage in multidisciplinary collaboration, and ultimately design innovative, human-centered solutions. The solutions identified were responsive to the user's needs and were specific to the local autism center where the study took place. However, the identified solutions may also apply to other settings and environments. For this setting, participants noted that environmental supports and adaptations to address sensory features could make the healthcare process more successful, and three specific solutions emerged: a SAE, sensory adaptations during medical procedures, and training for providers on sensory features in autism and how they may affect healthcare delivery.\n\nDT was a successful, innovative approach to address this problem and develop meaningful solutions. DT has been recently used in healthcare to generate creative solutions to challenging healthcare issues. The engagement of a multidisciplinary team in an innovative way can improve the utilization and acceptability of the solutions identified, increase adherence, improve outcomes, and empower stakeholders toward greater participation in research and evidence-based interventions [24]. The engagement of stakeholders in this interactive process ensured that voices were heard and that the solutions generated were responsive to the stakeholders' concerns and needs [25]. The design-thinking process provides a model for others interested in finding innovative solutions to complex and multifaceted problems.\n\nAlthough there is ample literature describing the challenges of autistic individuals related to their sensory features, there is a paucity of literature describing specific environmental interventions to address these challenges for improved healthcare participation. This study detailed specific strategies and solutions that could address these sensory challenges during healthcare for this center. Importantly, each environment and setting should be considered individually, as solutions will vary based on the setting, population, and site needs. For example, a SAE with specific zones to address sensory needs may be useful in some environments but not in others. Further, it is important to have a professional, such as an occupational therapist with expertise in sensory integration, knowledgeable about the adverse effects of sensory experiences. Many autistic individuals experience both hyper-reactivity and hypo-reactivity to sensations that may influence behavior [5]. Professional support can facilitate positive outcomes and assist with transitioning from this environment back to a clinic.\n\nOur findings are consistent with Wood et\u00a0al. [30], Litwin and Sellen [15], and Cermak et\u00a0al. [7], who explored adaptations to the physical and social environment to improve participation in emergency departments or dental exams for autistic individuals. They found that immediate, short-term solutions such as sensory tool kits or carts can be helpful. Similarly, our study found that implementing these adaptations was a potential solution to address the sensory needs of this population. One unique feature of the current study is that a more permanent, long-term solution was generated-creating a prototype for a permanent SAE room. This important finding might be considered in other healthcare facilities with the space and resources.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 20396, "end_char_idx": 31503, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "------------------\nMetadata:\n{metadata_str}\n\nContent:\n\n{content}\n------------------", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "72b99f1d-2f5f-44f8-9549-573d3a5ad5e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "72b99f1d-2f5f-44f8-9549-573d3a5ad5e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\s44202-024-00118-5.pdf", "file_name": "s44202-024-00118-5.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 899379, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_path", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "af0963f0-7fae-4d57-9509-367a8c21d51b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\s44202-024-00118-5.pdf", "file_name": "s44202-024-00118-5.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 899379, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "62ccdfb58073f6baeaa29025873949885eb6dd76ef1af8ea9e8ddb2b09488e30", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1214d5ea-2d18-4fd0-94f3-9bf0365e0740", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\SAAD MASTERS and UK\\DMU\\Modules\\Project - CSIP5501_2024_615\\Dev\\autism-parent-assistant\\data\\docs\\s44202-024-00118-5.pdf", "file_name": "s44202-024-00118-5.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 899379, "creation_date": "2025-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "a4b593b0b96ff2fca09cd65e20147e1c2e2d454b71d2c72bad75062c6752bdc9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "117974e0-3027-41f3-baa7-7dff62e61c92", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "04e0f2d8cad6fe2aee144438408448c373b20332fa26b6052884b9c175edf57d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "One unique feature of the current study is that a more permanent, long-term solution was generated-creating a prototype for a permanent SAE room. This important finding might be considered in other healthcare facilities with the space and resources.\n\nSAEs are being implemented in a variety of settings beyond medical environments. Park et\u00a0al. [21] designed an SAE in a public high school with successful results. Similarly, many sports stadiums and airports now have SAE available to improve the experience of autistic children and their families in these environments [1, 22]. Given that the SAE designed in this study emerged directly from stakeholders' input by engaging them in an interactive process, it has direct relevance for the setting in which it was created. It is essential to acknowledge that each type of setting may have different goals, and the children they serve will have different sensory needs. Thus, it will be essential to design SAE according to these needs, and methods such as DT, which informs design through understanding stakeholder needs, may be an ideal\n\napproach. It may be helpful to complete a pre-visit screening with each child to identify the types of sensory activities or adaptations best suited for their sensory needs and then guide them accordingly.\n\nOne additional recommendation that emerged from the data was the importance of education for providers on sensory features and the sensory differences that many autistic persons experience. This finding is consistent with Wood et\u00a0al. [30], who implemented a training program for the hospital staff introducing the concept of 'sensory-informed care' for providers to learn about the sensory needs of this population as a basis for implementing strategies to address the needs. After the training, they found that providers felt more knowledgeable of their autistic patients' sensory needs and the environmental adaptations or modifications that could support them. Thus, they reported the implementation of sensory-adapted strategies with better success. Also important is the knowledge that SAEs differ from sensory treatment rooms that trained occupational therapists use to implement individually tailored sensory-motor interventions.\n\n## 4    Conclusions\n\nGaps persist in understanding and addressing the sensory features of autistic individuals during healthcare, and these often impact their receipt of needed healthcare services. Increased awareness of environmental adaptations and innovative approaches, such as design thinking, could substantially improve these outcomes. We share the results of this project as a valuable model for engaging stakeholders to create positive sensory experiences that can improve participation in healthcare and other essential activities.\n\n## 4.1    Limitations\n\nLimitations include that the study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, limiting the availability and use of sensory items previously offered to the patients by the center. Also, the parent interviews were conducted by phone. The parents completed the interviews but did not participate in the ideate and prototype stages where the solutions were crafted. All the group meetings were conducted online. Although most participants were comfortable interacting in a virtual space, it is possible that it may have impacted some participants' willingness to speak up. In addition, the sample of parents who participated in the interviews was small due to time constraints, which may impact generalizability. All healthcare providers were English speakers, and information was not collected on their years of experience. Finally, by design, the project was specific to the healthcare facility where the study took place. Although this increases the utility of the findings for this site, it may decrease the appropriateness for other sites.\n\nAcknowledgements Thank you to the parents, providers, and design experts who participated in the study.
